Append-only session log, newest at top. What each session actually did;
GO_FORWARD_PLAN.md stays lean and forward-only.

## 2026-07-09 ~evening -- HEAD 5a09984c (v2.0-alpha)

Did:
- 5-agent Sonnet QA fan-out on all 4 source-bank routes + ledger contract
  (operator skipped further live smokes). Synthesis:
  docs/2026-07-09-source-route-qa/QA_SYNTHESIS.md (local; dated dirs are
  gitignored).
- FIXED+PUSHED 321bcc9c: closing-seam bank routing (QA F1) -- coda/announcer
  seams pack-route; PD+Shakespeare coda re-authored to bridge contract;
  title_form_label wired; 30 tests. NOTE: a second actor (operator's Codex
  loop) co-committed 40535ddc with dia hardening mid-session.
- FIXED+PUSHED 5a09984c: produced-story meta split -- K.5.6 summary pass
  stamps meta["produced_story"]; credits/HUD/treatment/music repointed.
- Seated tencent/hy3:free on the roundtable panel until 2026-07-21
  (62962121) + CLAUDE.md section 8 arc routing (R1 cloud, r2-r4 kibitz).
- original_radio R1 COMPLETE: ARCHITECTURE_V1 + anchor review -> live
  4-model roundtable (GPT-5.6-sol / Gemini-3.1-pro / DeepSeek-v4-pro /
  hy3:free; ~$0.13) -> pass01_judgment.md -> ARCHITECTURE_V2.md. Key
  redesigns: creative front (concept/select/brief) runs INSIDE
  build_original_briefs at D.2 BEFORE structure; v2-plan naming adopted
  (original_multi_pass + original_*_system seams); whole-script
  original_qa gate; disclosure must EXPLICITLY say machine-generated;
  cast pass collapsed; num_characters widget feeds the concept pass.

- R1 pass02 run on ARCHITECTURE_V3 (operator overrides: Hitchcock ironic
  epilogue instead of spoken disclosure; NO era frame / raw timeless
  story; RUNNABLE ON BUILD, no staged flips, no fallbacks, HARD FAILS
  ACCEPTED; north star = max story complexity / max code elegance).
  Panel 4x"no" -> judged -> **ARCHITECTURE_V4.md = BUILD SPINE**. Key:
  the epilogue is the ANNOUNCER OUTRO line (empty news_close_brief
  routes there; outro already knows the produced ending) -- zero new
  passes; disclosure lives in the printed layer (news_used + bank-aware
  HUD label replacing hardcoded "NEWS SEED" + unconditional credits
  line); anachronism defense is prompt-side + lexicon only.

Current step: original_radio campaign -- R1 CONVERGED (2 passes,
~$0.26 total). Next: /kibitz r2 (coding plan) on
docs/2026-07-09-original-radio/ARCHITECTURE_V4.md (+V2/V3 as context),
then r3 wiring, r4 convergence, then build: tests first, SAME-COMMIT
registry set SHIPPING runnable:true, pre-ship gates = suite + Bug Bible
+ mocked pipeline + live 30w smoke + operator eyeball.
Commits: 62962121, (40535ddc co-authored), 321bcc9c, 5a09984c -- all pushed.
