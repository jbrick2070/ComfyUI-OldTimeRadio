# OTR Go-Forward Plan

**Forward-only.** Open work, live bugs, standing operator rules, the budget ladder.
Completed work lives in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` (newest at top) and every prior
revision of this file is in git. If a thing is DONE, it does not belong here.

Leaned 2026-08-04 from 5,392 lines to this, on the operator's instruction to make
it "truly stuff that is not done". Nothing open was dropped: every live bug row,
operator ruling, flagged decision and proof obligation was carried across; what
went was four session batons, thirteen `SUPERSEDED` blocks, the closed
(struck-through) bug rows, eight superseded validation receipts, and the
window-letter table for slots that no longer exist.

## ON DECK -- A CODING SESSION, ~2h40m (operator directive 2026-08-04)

**NO RENDER RUNS THIS SESSION.** The operator wants coding, not GPU time:
"I don't think we need any runs right now, I want coding sessions." **D2 is
PARKED** -- it is a render task and it waits. Do not boot the headless server,
do not reset the box, do not start a leg. The D2 brief is preserved further down
under "PARKED -- D2" for whenever renders resume.

Everything below was verified against the real files on 2026-08-04, is
non-GPU, and is provable by the suite alone. Work them in order; each ends
green and pushed on its own.

### HARD GATE FOR THIS SPRINT -- NO CODE SHIPS WITHOUT A FULL KIBITZ (operator directive 2026-08-04)

Operator: "for the next coding sprint be sure any coding work has a full
`/kibitz-plugin:kibitz` review." **This is a gate, not a suggestion.** Now also
written into `CLAUDE.md` above the two-strikes rule, because that older rule says
a first-try root fix does not need a panel and would otherwise win the conflict.

* **FULL = the default four-round arc.** r1 arc -> r2 coding -> r3 wiring -> r4
  convergence; 8 external calls (two reviewers x four rounds). Not a scoped tail,
  not one round, not a continuation receipt. If a round genuinely cannot run, say
  which one and why -- a partial campaign is NEVER reported as a full arc.
* **Invoke `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` by name.** `anthropic-skills:kibitz` is the
  older duplicate; it is not what was asked for.
* **Panel = Codex + Antigravity.** Claude drives from Cowork, so the driver's own
  family is excluded -- do not launch a second `claude -p` lane against yourself.
* **Use the ComfyUI profile.** `.kibitz/comfyui.local.md` is already in the repo
  (written 2026-07-11). Regenerate via `kibitz/scripts/comfyui_profile.py` if the
  tree has moved past it. Node contract, widget/`widgets_values` drift and
  `IS_CHANGED` are exactly the defect classes this sprint can produce.
* **Anchor first, judge last.** Write `driver_anchor.md` from the REAL Windows
  files (Desktop Commander -- never the lagging Linux mount) BEFORE the fan-out,
  then ground every panel claim and discard the misreads. A panel run on a false
  premise is worse than no panel.
* **When it binds:** the campaign runs on the item's plan BEFORE the code, and its
  MUST-FIX list is answered BEFORE the commit. The panel does not replace the
  suite and the suite does not replace the panel -- both, every item.
* **Batching (default; override freely):** one campaign per item, EXCEPT items 2
  and 3 may share one if they ship in one commit. Item 1 gets its own, no
  exceptions -- it is the 90-minute prompt-and-plumbing change and is precisely
  what a panel is for. Item 4 gets its own.
* **Artifacts:** `docs/2026-08-05-<topic>/kibitz/` with the per-round
  `input.md`, `driver_anchor.md`, reviewer files, `judgment.md`, `final.md`.
  UTF-8, no BOM.

Kibitz is CPU/API only and costs the operator nothing, so it never competes with
work for the GPU -- but it does cost wall-clock. Four campaigns is real time on
top of the ~2h40m of coding below. If the session runs short, finish FEWER items
fully reviewed rather than more items unreviewed.

### 1. THE FIDELITY LANES ARE TOLD TO CARRY WORDS THEY ARE NEVER SHOWN (~90 min)

The headline defect, and the one that manufactured "Arkham, Massachusetts" over
H. G. Wells. Both fidelity packs order the model to carry the author's language:

* `nodes/story_packs/public_domain/faithful_radio_adaptation.json:13`
  (`exchange_system`) -- "Where the source gives these characters words, CARRY
  THEM. Keep their diction, their rhythm, their argument."
* `nodes/story_packs/shakespeare/folger_scene_adaptation.json:13` -- the same
  instruction in the Folger voice.

And `nodes/_otr_compose_exchange.py` (994 lines) has **ZERO** references to
`source_text`, `full_text`, `source_meta` or `excerpt` -- verified by grep, count
is literally 0. **The instruction is bound to an absent document.** A model told
to carry words it cannot see will invent words and believe it complied. That is
the whole mechanism.

Two legs, BOTH required -- one without the other just moves the guess:

**(a) Put the source text in front of the composer.** The window threads
`build_exchange_prompt` (`:292`, with `_grounding_pool` at `:270`) <-
`compose_exchange` (`:550`) <- `run_exchange_prepass` (`:881`) <-
`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter`. The material already exists and already arrives: the
payload carries `full_text`, PROVEN on 2026-08-04 when 1,988 words of authentic
Wells reached `fetch_public_domain_source` through the production seam. Nothing
needs fetching -- it needs passing.

**(b) Deterministic world anchors.** New manifest `world_line` + `anchor_terms`
flowing through the EXISTING `source_meta` / `key_terms` owners
(`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:1725`, `:1807`, `:1888`), so place and era arrive as
FACT rather than as something the model reconstructs from a 2-3 sentence brief.

**Two rules from the 08-03 craft brief, both hard-won, both easy to violate:**
1. **Never name the feared failure.** Writing "no Arkham" into a prompt IMPLANTS
   Arkham. Forbid by CATEGORY, never by example.
2. **Every fidelity instruction must be PAIRED with the material it binds to.**
   An unpaired "carry the words" is the bug, not the fix.

**Ceiling to be honest about:** this can be built and unit-tested here, but its
real proof is a render, and renders are parked. Ship it green and UNPROVEN, and
say so in the handoff. Do not write "fixed" where "built, not yet proven on a
leg" is the truth.

### 2. THE NON-COMMERCIAL NOTICE REACHES NO HUMAN SURFACE (~30 min)

Fully scoped, ledger-clean, and the smallest real win on the board.
`nodes/OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3590` stamps `meta["noncommercial_notice"]` (via
`_otr_provenance.noncommercial_notice`, `:124`) and logs it. **Nothing renders
it.** `nodes/otr_credits_roll.py:516` reads only `credits_source_line`.

Add a sibling printed-credits item beside that block -- `:516-518` is the exact
three-line shape to copy -- plus an integration test. The ledger field already
exists and already has an owner, so this adds a CONSUMER, not a field: no
ownership question to answer. Fires on Folger sources.

### 3. THE GUARDRAIL RIP LEFT A DANGLING COMMA IN BOTH PROMPTS (~10 min)

Found 2026-08-04 while reading the packs for item 1. Both forbid-lists end mid-
sentence with a stray `,.`:

* public_domain: `"Do NOT introduce a new protagonist, unrelated framing story,
  changed ending,."`
* shakespeare: `"Do NOT introduce a modern mystery, new protagonist, unrelated
  framing story,."`

That is residue from the 08-03 removal of the "blood, guns, knives, and graphic
violence" clause -- the item was deleted, its comma was not. It is not cosmetic:
this is a LIVE prompt string a model reads on every fidelity episode, and a
sentence that stops at a dangling comma reads as truncated instruction. Close
both sentences. Do NOT restore the removed clause -- the rip was the operator's
directive and it stands.

### 4. THE TEST-ORDERING POLLUTION (~30 min)

`tests/test_public_domain_sources.py` pollutes
`tests/test_public_domain_interpreter.py::test_empty_cast_is_rejected_and_retried_to_failure`.
Confirmed 2026-08-04: fails when the two run adjacently, passes **11/11** when
the interpreter file runs alone, invisible in full-suite order. Pre-existing --
already proven by stashing and reproducing at the prior commit.

Worth the half hour because it costs a real signal: any targeted run touching
those two files reports a red line that has to be re-diagnosed as benign every
time. Find the leaked module/global state, isolate it with a fixture, and delete
the standing footnote.

### BENCH -- only if the four above land early

* **The three works that refuse to vendor:** `ghost_ship` (gid 11045),
  `purple_cloud` (11229), `beleaguered_city` (11521) --
  `scripts/otr_vendor_public_domain_library.py:303/341/542`, unusual heading
  formats against the parser at `:594-686`. **Needs one Gutenberg fetch**, so it
  is not purely offline; take it only if a fetch is acceptable.
* `OTRImageGenDispatcher` has no `IS_CHANGED` while depending on external file
  existence.
* Rotated server logs have no retention policy.

**Do NOT start the Shakespeare verbatim executor in this session.** It is a
multi-session structural change gated on the ownership table
(`docs/2026-08-03-fidelity-pass-ownership.md`) with four overwrite paths to close
first, and starting it half-way is worse than not starting it.

## PARKED -- D2 (resume when the operator wants renders again)

Reset per AGENTS.md section 4, boot headless, run **320-word `public_domain` or
`shakespeare` still legs until one fails** (~1 in 6). Three legs on 08-04 all
published, which at that rate is a ~58% chance of zero -- neither confirmed nor
cleared.

**Either outcome is valid.** A publish is a clean leg; a **fail-closed with
complete evidence is the PROOF D1 WORKS** and is the outcome you want. When it
fails the server log names the branch itself -- arm, token, index, canonical
`prompt_hash`, repr-escaped excerpt -- plus a compact JSON `MISSING_TARGET`
record emitted BEFORE the raise (the canonical runner truncates the exception at
500 chars, `scripts/otr_api.py:749`). The log survives reboot;
`scripts/_otr_rotate_log.ps1` rotates instead of truncating. D3 then fixes THAT
branch at its root and `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` gets a mechanism, not a guess.

**Do NOT:** weaken the completion gate, revive the portrait-init fallback, or
rebuild the withdrawn "give the collapse guard a still owner" fix -- the 08-04
postmortem disproved that chain (70 whiffs and 69 cast-time deferrals across 11
passes that ALL published).

Record: `docs/2026-08-04-POSTMORTEM-still-unmaterialized-320w.md`,
`docs/2026-08-04-D1-SHIPPED-still-skip-evidence.md`.

## AFTER THIS SPRINT -- the standing block order

One coder window at a time; every chunk = focused tests + full suite + Bug Bible
+ commit AND push + `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.

```text
  -> WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract  (CODE-COMPLETE; blocked on ONE operator
                                         decision -- see OPEN BUGS)
  -> [r3+r4] Randomizer A
  -> [r3+r4] dynamic_story           (wiring only -- rev-5 DESIGN stays FINAL)
  -> [R4.1 refit = its re-ground] SFX campaign (after Timeline Cue Ledger C0/C1)
  -> re-observe the PARKED story bugs; batch-triage whatever is left
  -> THEN, and only then, ROADMAP.md -- OFF THIS PLAN
       (its order: SFX -> product expansion -> LEAN-MEAN -> RunPod -> release)
```

**LEAN-MEAN IS NOT IN THIS QUEUE and must not be re-added.** Operator direction
2026-07-29 moved FRONT and TAIL both to the Lean-mean campaign section of
`ROADMAP.md`, with their chunk chains, the W2 migration-first mandate, the
ENGINE_MATRIX W6 sub-step and the full `r2 -> r3 -> r4` pin carried over intact.
It runs after the randomizer and SFX. A window that wants to rip dead code is on
the wrong document.

**Block detail:**

1. **Randomizer Rolls Design A** -- `docs/2026-07-12-randomizer-rolls-r2-coding-plan.md`.
   NOT gated any more: extensibility landed and absorbed its `_otr_lane_specs`
   authority, so this shrinks to `_otr_bank_roll` + eligibility. Its r3 brief must
   carry two deltas -- the absorbed authority, and that the bank list is a LIVE
   registry read (`list_bank_ids()` can return a CLIENT bank; eligibility must
   treat one as an ordinary peer) rather than a six-row literal. 1-2 d + 1 GPU day.
2. **`dynamic_story` visual direction** -- rev-5 FINAL; roster-agnostic; re-derive
   IDs at build. After the randomizer. The "do not rerun the design panels" rule
   and the r3+r4 requirement are NOT in conflict: the rule protects the DESIGN,
   r3 asks whether that design still wires to the code that exists today, and the
   roster, the routing authority and the writer tail have all moved since rev-5.
   5-9 coder-days + 2-4 GPU days.
3. **SFX campaign** (after the Timeline Cue Ledger C0/C1 gate). The R4.1 refit
   already IS this block's re-ground -- do not schedule a second one. The
   generated-SFX R4 candidate stays local/ignored evidence until refit into a
   tracked current-HEAD R4.1 plan. No second SFX queue, no library fallback.

Open judgment question (render-window, not a coder slot): the LOCAL mistral/gemma
writer matrix. The Sonnet arm of the creative-writer question is answered
(`docs/2026-07-17-model-bakeoff-scoreboard.md`); the local roster comparison
never ran.

### STANDING RE-GROUND GATE -- r3/r4 before ANY block above (operator 2026-07-24)

Every remaining block was planned against a tree that no longer exists. Since
those docs were written the LLM vetoes were ripped, THE LAW landed, six banks were
renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings were retired, the whole extensibility
build shipped, and the suite grew past 8,000. Line cites, seam names and file
inventories are the first things to rot, and every one of these blocks is a rip or
a rewire that acts on exactly those.

- **Default entry point is `r3` (wiring).** These plans already have an r1 and an
  r2 on record, so the cheap re-ground is wiring against CURRENT code, then `r4`.
- **Drop to `r2` when r3 finds the CODING PLAN wrong**, not just the line numbers.
  Stale cites are an r3 fix. A seam that no longer exists, an authority that moved,
  a precondition another build already satisfied or destroyed -- that invalidates
  the coding plan itself, and patching an r2 from inside an r3 produces a plan
  nobody reviewed.
- **If in doubt, start at r2.** A wasted r2 costs one panel round; executing a
  stale coding plan costs a day of rips against the wrong file list.
- **No block executes without an r4 convergence at current HEAD.** Record the run
  under `kibitz-runs/<date>-<block>-r<N>/` and cite it in the block entry.

## SCOPE FOR v2.0 (operator -- read before picking up fidelity work)

**Two banks, not three.** `shakespeare` is VERBATIM and gets the executor.
`public_domain` stays PROSE and is explicitly allowed to be FUZZY -- operator: "the
LLM's job to try to do book prose but not perfect", and "I'm fine if it can pick up
real dialogue great, if not that's OK". Best-effort, never verbatim, never gated.

**But fuzzy WORDING is not the same as melding two stories, and that distinction is
the actual requirement.** Operator: "public domain does need to be updated so it
doesn't try to meld two different radio drama things and tries to keep true to the
source." That names the delivered defect exactly -- an H.G. Wells chapter performed
as taking place in "Arkham, Massachusetts", Lovecraft's fictional town, with the
time machine shrunk to a pocket watch. Two authors fused into one episode. The
contract for this bank:

* FREE with the wording. Invent the speech; carry the source's own quoted lines
  where they exist (the Wells chapter has real ones -- "Story!" cried the Editor).
* NOT free with the WORLD. Its place, people, period and events are the source's.
  No relocating, no importing a second work's setting or characters, no genre
  transposition.

Two changes serve that, and neither is a gate:
1. **PROMPT-ONLY** -- the pack asks for the source's world and its own quoted
   speech, and forbids importing anything the source does not contain.
2. **Stop the content-blind rolls contaminating it.** A catalog sound world ("a
   fire in the grate, a mantel clock, a teacup") was imposed on Wells' Richmond
   parlour, and `arc_shape` stamped "heist" on a man demonstrating a time machine.
   Foreign frames arriving from a dice roll are melding by another route.

**`public_domain_plays` is DEFERRED TO v2.1**
(`docs/2026-08-03-public-domain-plays-PLAN.md`, research complete, nothing built).
That avoids a third bank row, which is never one line: it would force a pack
directory, a registered fetcher, an executable pipeline, family-policy coverage and
updates to exact-roster contract tests.

**Two hard operator rules that override the repo's written ethos here:**
* **The word count is a REQUEST, not a gate.** No refusals, no hard gates, no
  shunts. Shipped: `select_passage` returns its closest performable passage rather
  than raising (`a4bc7917`).
* **No "dread py assertion workflow killers."** A render must not die. The
  reconciliation: fail loud in AUTHORING-TIME TOOLS (the fetcher, manifest
  validation -- things a human runs and reads), but in the RENDER PATH degrade to
  the best available result and write an honest machine-readable receipt into the
  ledger saying what degraded and why. The ledger tells the truth; the episode
  still ships. No hazard / under-construction flags -- `runnable` was checked and is
  NOT one; all six real banks are runnable and its only job is making the
  "+ Add Your Own" signpost fail loud on selection.

**An extra LLM VERIFIER pass is sanctioned** ("is this accurate to the story, are
these characters really in the scene?") -- but as a RE-SELECT, never an abort: if it
rejects a window, take the next-best candidate, bounded, then ship the best one with
a receipt.

**Casting must be smart about voices and gender.** The dramatis personae section is
the ROSTER and its descriptions carry gender; it is parsed at VENDOR time into the
provenance sidecar so the render path never infers (`d8752d69`). A manifest-approved
roster also replaces the refuted "speaker appears twice" heading rule -- that rule
would have deleted BEATRICE's single speech from `much_ado__act3_scene1`, the scene
named for her, where that one speech IS the payoff.

**Still open on casting:**
* **Midsummer 1/12 and Comedy of Errors 1/7 gendered** -- mechanicals and servants
  in cast-list shapes not yet read, recorded `unknown` rather than guessed. Operator
  is open to a vendor-time LLM/web lookup as the final tier for stragglers, under
  its own `gender_source` so it stays auditable. (Corpus elsewhere: AYL 6/6, Lear
  9/9, R&J 3/3, Much Ado 4/4, Tempest 3/3, Twelfth Night 5/6, Macbeth 7/8.)
* **Voice-pool capacity may belong in window ELIGIBILITY, not just casting.** The
  Bark pool is 6 male / 4 female against a 6-character ceiling, and Macbeth 1.3
  needs five distinct voices.
* **Disguise ruling (settled):** ROSALIND-as-Ganymede and VIOLA-as-Cesario keep
  FEMALE voices -- the source prefix says who speaks and the irony depends on the
  audience hearing her; the announcer states the disguise from a manifest field.

**Visual style: randomized is fine** (operator). The earlier objection to
`archival_documentary` over a Folger comedy was about TRUTHFULNESS, not variety --
the credits claimed a story scaffold the episode did not have. With the words
genuinely the play's own and the strip naming the real source, a randomly drawn look
is artistic range. (`visual_style_policy` was RIPPED on 2026-08-04 accordingly.)

## THE PASSAGE LANE (operator ruling; built, with craft criteria still unbuilt)

> "For shakespeare I'm open to a version that is very strict and finds, based on
> word count and random choice, hones in on a specific part of a play to get real
> specific dialogue, no paraphrasing."

A play episode is a contiguous WINDOW of consecutive speeches, carried verbatim,
chosen to fit the word budget, the cast ceiling and the beat topology. Built as
`nodes/_otr_passage_selector.py` (`a82460ec`), 24 tests, proven on all 14 vendored
scenes: every selected line is verbatim from its source file.

**The number that governs everything:** a passage is performed against VOICED
BEATS, and beats step with the ACT TOPOLOGY, not the word count --
`voiced_beat_count()` in `_otr_episode_budget` is the one owner. 30-120 target words
buy THREE beats, 150-200 six, 300-1200 fourteen. At 120 words a passage is a
two-or-three speech fragment; at 300 it is an eleven-to-thirteen speech exchange.
**The fidelity floor should be 300, not the operator's initial 120** -- three beats
cannot hold a change of mind, and every manifest already recommends 300. A long
speech spans consecutive beats in the same voice (`ceil(words/80)`,
`BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX`); without that the lane silently loses Lear's love test,
Prospero's history and Juliet's balcony speeches.

**Craft criteria for selection, from the Fable review -- NOT yet implemented:** keep
windows inside one French scene (never cross an `[Enter ...]` that adds a speaker);
prefer starts on an entrance or a question, penalise openings on continuation words
(And/But/Nay/'Tis) and speeches under 4 words (Folger prints shared verse lines
separately, so those start mid-breath); prefer ends on an exit, a scene end or a
rhymed couplet, avoid ending on a question or a trailing dash. Score, keep the top
K, then apply the seeded hash within that class. Showcase example: Romeo and Juliet
2.2 lines 257-318, `[Enter Juliet above again.]` "Hist, Romeo, hist!" through
"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes... [He exits.]" -- 14 speeches, ~250 words, entrance
start, couplet-and-exit end, a complete arc that maps 1:1 onto the 14-beat topology.

**Prose is a different lane and the review was blunt about it.** Wells' chapter is
~70% narration; a characters-only performance discards the book's actual asset. The
faithful prose lane should be a NARRATOR/READER role speaking the author's own
sentences, abridged by CUTTING ONLY with every dropped span logged in provenance --
"abridged verbatim", which is also the period-correct radio form. Defer the
paraphrased variant until a dialogue-poor source genuinely needs it: as specced it is
indistinguishable to a listener from the existing original lane with borrowed names,
and it reopens the failure class just closed. If built, the announcer must say
"freely adapted from".

**Also flagged, unfixed:** the per-beat word FLOOR (20 at three acts) excludes
stichomythia -- "Nothing, my lord." / "Nothing?" / "Nothing." cannot be three beats --
so rapid exchanges need a merge rule or a floor exemption; `[aside]` and `[within]`
are machine-readable delivery hints worth carrying into per-beat metadata; and the
Wells manifest synopsis says the traveller "returns with a strange machine" when in
the real chapter he returns limping and the machine never appears.

## THE ADAPTATION DESIGN (hardened, NOT yet built)

Plan of record: `kibitz-runs/2026-08-03-adaptation-fidelity/r2/final.md`.

**The keystone correction: compile source speech, do not generate it.** A ledger row
that merely POINTS at a source segment proves structure, not meaning --
`PRODUCTION_SPRINT_LESSONS.md` lesson 11 documents that exact failure class.
Source-owned text must be materialized deterministically from an authenticated
segmented artifact and verified against it. "Summarize into X words" then means
SELECTING WHICH REAL SEGMENTS FIT THE BUDGET, not paraphrasing -- which also removes
the VRAM hazard, since no model sits in the source-speech path.

Settled by arithmetic: an episode cannot exceed **1,520 words** (19 voiced beats at
act_count 7, `BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX` 80), so full-scene performance is impossible
without redesigning beat topology. Build target is the 300-word unit.

**NEXT, IN ORDER:**

1. **The segmented source artifact** (schema, spans, hashes,
   `body[start:end] == segment.text`, omission receipts) and the pass-to-field
   ownership table -- **nothing else codes until that table exists.**
2. **Cast from the selected cut.** Real scenes carry 3-12 speakers against a
   6-character ceiling (`_otr_casting.py` 1-6, `OutlineRequest` rejects >6), so which
   speakers appear must follow from the cut that fits the word budget. Coupled hard
   to the capacity guard: at act_count 1 there are exactly THREE voiced beats, so a
   4-person cast is a mathematically guaranteed `CastVoiceCoverageError` -- the
   failure that killed `scifi_news` in the six-bank run. `compute_episode_budget`
   must also receive the TRUE locked cast.
3. **Loosen the count-match invariant** (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4061-4067` hard-
   raises on any locked != requested) and change the pack text that tells the model
   to drop figures.
4. **Extend `_otr_provenance.py`** -- do not add a second attribution owner -- and
   bind its output to the verified body hash.
5. **Schema migration** to retire `cast_hints`; still required by the validators and
   by `public_domain_manifest_schema.json`, so manifests and tests migrate in the
   same change. (`visual_style_policy`, the other half of this item, was ripped
   2026-08-04.)

**KNOWN AND NOT FIXED:** `canonicalize_shakespeare_text` truncates at 12,000 chars
and the interpreter sees only the first 5,000, so a 3,445-word scene reaches the
brief as ~880 words, silently. Belongs with the artifact work, where each beat is
fed its own segment rather than a blind prefix.

## STYLE / IDENTITY DECISION WORK (one campaign, next CODER window)

Grounded by the 2026-08-03 four-agent forensics; every line has a file:line in the
session traces.

1. **"Invent one and tag it"**: add a derived style/genre field to
   `run_story_brief_reflection` (`_otr_story_brief.py:446` -- proven content-loyal on
   both specimens), stamp beside `story_brief`, repoint the treatment `Style:` line
   (`video_engine.py:1762`) and the HUD (`video_engine.py:1336` -> `_build_left`
   `:1466`) at it. Highest-leverage item here: it fixes the credits line for all six
   banks uniformly.
2. **Rename `meta.style` -> `meta.story_scaffold`** (operator: too many metas; the
   field is neither scifi nor a description). Consumers move in one change: writer
   stamps, credits `_story_style_receipt`, `visual_plan.style`,
   `video_engine.py:1336`, tests.
3. **Ghost-name reconciliation fork**: pitch cast never reaches `lock_cast` (names
   are a pure pool draw; `source_character_names` deliberately None for invention
   lanes). Decide: scrub briefs after cast lock, or propagate pitch names. Evidence:
   Evelyn/Leonard as offscreen lore; Fogbound Rails bio still opens "Lizzie Gray".
4. **Dead fields found**: `ending_template` computed but zero LineRequest call sites
   pass it; `seed_policy.style_seed_env` validated but unconsumed; `dramatic_state`
   derived PRE-dialogue goes stale in the treatment.
5. **`meta` is a 120-key drawer** -- the cleanup the operator keeps asking for. Scope
   as its own rip with the ledger law (every field one owner).

## OPEN OPERATOR QUESTIONS (flagged, awaiting a ruling)

* **Does `media_archive` want the catalog premise at all**, or the same
  scaffold-off treatment as `original`? Found by the five-bank beat test: a
  `pirate_radio_resistance_drama` premise was drawn over a film-reel standoff
  seeded by a real Library of Congress item on 'Midnight' (1939) -- the operator
  caught it on screen. Second specimen of the content-blind-draw class. The
  scaffold-off rule so far was stated only for `original`.
* **Rename the un-namespaced `OTR_WAN_*` knobs?** `eng_wan_i2v`'s six frozen knobs
  are `OTR_WAN_STEPS` / `_CFG` / `_SHIFT` / `_SAMPLER` / `_SCHEDULER` / `_NEGATIVE`
  -- no `I2V` namespace, unlike every sibling. Default if unruled: leave them. The
  freeze already removed the power that made the missing namespace dangerous (they
  are consent-act-only now and cannot bind a production leg), and a rename would
  silently break operator muscle memory for a sweep.
* **`style_tail_policy`'s closed enum cannot express a SHIPPED path.**
  `VALID_STYLE_TAIL_POLICIES` has `full` and `minimal_clean`, but
  `build_radio_host_prompt`'s `ltx_radio_mouth` branch
  (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:394-401`) RETURNS EARLY with
  `"%s, warm dramatic lighting"`, skipping both `finish_visual_prompt(...,
  era_profile="still")` and the `image_grade_tail` append -- deliberately, per the
  2026-07-02 operator look direction. The `ltx_audio_in` bookend row nonetheless
  declares `style_tail_policy="full"`. Adding an enum token is an operator call:
  either add a third token for "canonical warm, no era tail, no grade tail", or
  ratify that the `ltx_radio_face` path is EXEMPT from the plan's style-tail
  authority. Default if unruled: the exemption, because it changes no behaviour.
* **After profile retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The full
  statement of this one is in the WAN 8-GB row under OPEN BUGS -- it is the single
  blocker on a code-complete block.
* **`check_compatibility`: ratify the inert constant, or schedule the rip?** See
  Open risks.

## OPEN BUGS / DEFECTS (live, not yet closed)

MECHANICAL defects survive story-engine churn; STORY-QUALITY judgments do not. That
split is why the two eyeball-era entries at the end are PARKED rather than live.

**EVERY LINE CITE IN THIS SECTION IS SUSPECT.** Each one checked during the
2026-07-27 triage had moved: `_is_cloud_video_engine` is `render_driver.py:1599` not
`1274-1295`; the "NO FALLBACK to text-only" refusal is `:2148` not `1801-1817`;
`_use_i2v` is `eng_ltx_video.py:583` not `559-572`. The defects are mostly still
real; their coordinates are not. **Re-pin a row's cite when you touch it.**

### The P0 / source-span cluster (2026-07-30)

- **`full_text` reaches the span coordinate system carrying HTML BLOCK JOINS WITH
  NO SEPARATOR, and on the live evidence this is the DOMINANT P0 failure cause.**
  Measured in the campaign logs: `'...Field of Martian PolygonsNASA/JPL-'`,
  `'...and the School ofEngine'`, `'...what you're doing.Let's s'`, `'...(AMR).The
  resea'`. The RSS adapter strips tags without inserting whitespace, so two elements
  fuse into one token. `_normalize_span_source_text` collapses whitespace RUNS but
  cannot insert a space that was never there, so the model quotes the sentences a
  reader sees and they are not byte-exact in the stored text -- exactly the
  "non-literal source span" rejection that killed 12 of the 15 P0 legs.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed by A-3:** inserting separators is a WIDER change to the
  coordinate system `source_digest` pins -- an operator decision, and it belongs in
  the source adapter rather than the codex normalizer. Owed: which adapter builds
  `full_text`, whether a separator can be inserted at admission without breaking any
  accepted ledger, and a fixture from these four strings.
- **The deterministic P0 rung PRUNES SILENTLY, which violates the plan's own
  Invariant 3.** `repair_literal_source_metadata` drops an unsupported span, then its
  evidence row, then the fact -- and emits no receipt. An accepted P0 index simply
  has fewer facts than the model wrote, and nothing says which were dropped or why.
  Under "fail loud, not fatal" the degrade is the right direction and the silence is
  not.
- **The deterministic P0 rung is ALL-OR-NOTHING across an artifact, and can poison
  its own good work.** It is handed `a0_payload` (all seven keys) while
  `_validate_fact_index` restricts spans to `allowed_source_fields` (the projection).
  A quote rehomed into a field the projection omitted makes `post_validator` reject
  the WHOLE repaired artifact -- "cites source field ... outside the supplied P0
  evidence" -- so one unlucky rehome discards every correct prune in the same pass.
  Either give the repairer the allowlist or prune per row.
- **Nothing measures whether a pruned P0 index is ACCEPTED** (recorded, no action
  owed yet). No live leg has ever run with the deterministic rung reachable (it became
  reachable at `47c554fa`, after the campaign stopped), and the rejection logs carry
  only a truncated `raw head` plus no source payload, so the question cannot be
  answered offline. A-1's instrumentation is what makes the next campaign able to
  answer it.
- **`scifi_news` P0 convergence defect** -- both 120w and 320w legs fail in P0 after
  two attempts on non-literal fact source spans; provider/model convergence, extends
  BUG-11.35. NOT a word/length gate. Blocks the last 120w receipt and the
  `scifi_news` live reverify (PBUGs 20260712-22/23/24/25, fixed in tree, reverify
  still owed).
- **`scifi_news_pro` provider capacity** -- `requested_output=2800` vs provider cap
  `512`; the whole-artifact retry contracts LANDED @ `314dd481` are the base; the
  residual fix is now unblocked. Related independent items: the P9 8K
  structured-capacity follow-up + the GGUF structured-enforcement NEWBUG. Do not
  raise the minimum word target as a capacity workaround.

### The 8 GB / profile cluster

- **WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract -- CODE-COMPLETE and PROOF-INCOMPLETE. It is
  not a coding item; the one thing blocking it is an OPERATOR DECISION.**

  **Already BUILT and WIRED end to end** (verified hop by hop): `otr_8gb_wan.json`
  `video.max_render_frames=17` -> `capability_profiles` optional-key validator ->
  `_otr_workflow_apply.py:532` flatten -> `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_wan.json`
  node-87 widget slot 14 = 17 -> `otr_video_director.py:423` policy stamp ->
  `otr_shot_lock.py:1722` `ledger.video.max_render_frames` ->
  `render_driver.py:3328` per-adapter policy -> `motion_common.profile_max_render_frames()`
  -> `eng_wan_ti2v._floor_length` hard cap (`:730`) and `_planned_length` refusal
  (`:785`), with `render_driver.py:3845` refusing on drift. Landed `f914f0a4`, dead
  node-87 widget repaired `7f4644a1` + `8f41af27`, WAN deliberately excluded from
  `frame_contract.PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` by `b23fc035`, recipe frozen `71753cb4` /
  `8424f369`, whole-beat single-UNET-load `439ce8c7`. Regression net:
  `tests/test_remaining_video_contracts.py:16-194` (nine hop-by-hop tests) plus
  `tests/test_multiclip_effective_contract.py:216,234`.

  **THE ONE OPERATOR DECISION (the actual blocker).** The ceiling reaches a leg ONLY
  through a variant workflow or a hand-set widget: `otr_canonical.json` node 87 ships
  `max_render_frames=0`, so a plain canonical WAN run is UNPINNED and inherits
  `_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES = 177` -- exactly the 2026-07-23 failure shape. The obvious patch
  (pin 17 in the canonical) is WRONG: the canonical serves every tier, and 17 is the
  8-GB tier's number, so pinning it would cap LTX/HuMo 16-GB legs too. The channel
  that carries 17 today is `config/profiles/*.json`, which is on the RETIREMENT list
  -- so writing new behaviour onto it is forbidden. **Decision needed: after profile
  retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The shape that fits the
  per-adapter-ownership doctrine is that `eng_wan_ti2v` DECLARES its own tier ceiling
  (a capability-row field), the widget becomes an operator OVERRIDE with 0 meaning
  "use the adapter's own contract", and the profile channel stops mattering. That is
  a real design change with a live-behaviour blast radius on any card with headroom
  (the VRAM predictor currently gets to ask for more than 17 and often can), so it is
  NOT being written on assumption. Ratify the shape first.

  **Also open, all PROOF obligations rather than build work:** the 18-engine GPU
  campaign is engine COVERAGE, not an 8-GB qualification; and a render on a PHYSICAL
  8 GB card is still owed -- the four-arm bench PREQUALIFIED on a 16 GB card told to
  reserve 8 GiB, which is not the same claim.

  **One untested edge, cheap to close whenever this reopens:** WAN is out of
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`, so a tier ceiling and a multi-clip plan CAN contradict by
  design, and `_planned_length` hard-refuses mid-episode when they do -- but no test
  asserts a 17-frame tier survives a multi-segment beat. `:216`/`:234` in
  `test_multiclip_effective_contract.py` pin the topology, not that outcome.

- **THE 8 GB PROFILE FAMILY CANNOT RUN ITS OWN WRITER** (found 2026-07-27;
  LIVE-REPRODUCED TWICE on two different banks, then confirmed by a two-strikes
  kibitz panel -- codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high and agy independently reached the same
  diagnosis). `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` pairs a 12B GGUF writer
  (`gemma-4-12b-it-Q4_K_M`, 6.63 GB of weights) with `llm.gguf_n_ctx: 2048` under a
  declared `vram_ceiling_gb: 6.8`. The pipeline's own smallest prompt needs **2064
  input tokens** and P0 reserves 2800 output (`_P0_BASE_OUTPUT_TOKENS`), so the leg
  dies in `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter` before any render. Live preflight, verbatim:
  `Needed=8.13 GB (weights=6.63, kv=1.40 @ n_ctx=2048)`. **ctx is the SYMPTOM; the
  writer MODEL is the cause** -- 4096 puts it near 9.4-9.5 GB, OOM on the very card
  the tier exists for. Every 2048-ctx profile (`otr_8gb_ltx`, `otr_8gb_wan`,
  `8gb_lite`, `cpu_floor`, `otr_amd8_rocm`, `otr_cloud_lanes`) is `status=draft` and
  every one pairs 2048 with the 12B; the only `status=shipping` profile is
  `16gb_full` (4096 + Mistral-Nemo). **NOT a one-line profile edit:** the GGUF
  registry ships exactly two rows (`unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF`,
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`); `google/gemma-2-2b-it` is in the TRANSFORMERS catalog, a
  different lane -- agy proposed it and was wrong, recorded so nobody re-derives it.
  **Largely mooted by profile retirement:** with no profile passed, the canonical
  JSON's own `gguf_n_ctx=4096` / Q8_0 binds and the leg runs. **Fix the profiles or
  finish retiring them; do not leave both.**

- **A2 -- HELD pending the profile retire-now vs retire-later scope. The profile's
  `llm` section silently overrides the canonical JSON, and the applied-overrides echo
  HIDES it.** Held because its entire subject is `apply_profile_to_workflow` and the
  printed echo -- a channel directed to be retired, so building on it now may be work
  on something scheduled for deletion. The fix SHAPE is correct and ready when the
  scope is settled. The profile's `llm.*` values win over the widgets the operator set
  in `otr_canonical.json` (which ships `creative`/`technical` = `google/gemma-4-12b-it`,
  `gguf_n_ctx=4096`, `gguf_quant=Q8_0`, `llm_vram_ceiling_gb=14.5`), while
  `scripts/otr_api.py:817` flattens only `role_overrides` / `slot_overrides` /
  `features` + two `seed_policy` keys for the printed summary -- so the run reports
  "16 overrides" while ALSO having replaced the entire LLM configuration. **Causal
  chain corrected** (triage 2026-07-27, codex; grounded): the override does NOT come
  from the validator's `OTR_ACTIVE_PROFILE` export -- it happens at submission,
  `scripts/otr_canonical_api_run.py:157` -> `apply_profile_to_workflow`; and the real
  applier (`nodes/_otr_workflow_apply.py:492-540`) ALREADY flattens `llm`; only the
  printed echo is stale. **Fix: generate the echo FROM the applier's flattened map.**
  Adding `llm` to the echo by hand leaves the next drift intact.

- **The `ltx_8gb` render-length ceiling has TWO owners that only agree by
  coincidence** (found 2026-07-27, B6 panel, two lenses independently). The coverage
  PLANNER reads `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` `video.max_render_frames`, and
  `ltx_8gb` is the sole member of `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`. The ADAPTER's own
  pre-render refusal reads `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES`. Today both land on 161 (profile
  unpinned, env unset), so nothing breaks. But `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_ltx.env.json`
  ships `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES=97` and NOTHING currently reads that file. The day a
  launcher honours it without also pinning the profile, the planner emits a 98-161
  frame segment and the adapter refuses it MID-EPISODE -- after the stills are minted
  and, on a multi-segment beat, after the 6.34 GiB checkpoint is hoisted.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed in B6:** pinning the profile to 97 changes how a 237-frame
  beat partitions, which is a production planning decision, not a cleanup. The preset
  carries a `_ceiling_note` saying do not export it alone. Compare WAN, which B3
  wired correctly: `otr_8gb_wan.json` sets BOTH `launch.env.OTR_WAN_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES`
  and `video.max_render_frames`.

### Coverage, canvas and clip-contract

- **The route lock is ONE NODE TOO LATE for the image phase** (found 2026-07-25, node
  order confirmed against the canonical JSON: `87 VideoDirector -> 88 ImageDirector ->
  89 MetaBrief -> 90 ShotLock -> 91 ImageGenDispatcher -> 92 VideoRenderBatch`).
  `resolve_final_shot_engines` runs at node 92, but stills are minted at 91 and image
  PROMPTS at 89. The landed fix closed the spine-validation gap; the image phase still
  relies on its own MIRROR (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt._effective_prompt_engine_for_role`,
  whose docstring says it "mirrors the image dispatcher's effective-engine seam").
  **Chunk 1 of the coverage block is the fix.** Note node 89 precedes node 90, so
  hoisting to ShotLock still does not put MetaBrief downstream of the authority --
  that needs a VideoDirector-time freeze and is NOT in scope. (This is also the
  "image-phase still ownership" item from the campaign queue.)
- **THREE silent coverage mechanisms exist, not one** (found 2026-07-25).
  Mechanism 1, the engine mirror/ping-pong (`wrapper_bridge.extend_frames_to_target`),
  is GONE from `eng_ltx_8gb` -- pinned behaviourally by a test that detonates the
  helper and renders successfully. It REMAINS in `eng_wan_ti2v`, deliberately and
  permanently: WAN renders a short native clip on purpose and fills the beat with it,
  which is the shipped 8GB tier contract `PBUG-20260723-02` protects. **Still open:**
  composite loop-fill (`otr_silent_composite._should_loop_fill`, which also SUPPRESSES
  its own underrun warning once it activates) and held-last-frame. For `ltx_8gb` the
  composite path is now de facto unreachable -- the adapter returns exactly the
  requested count or raises -- but not structurally impossible:
  `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` reports the size of the array it piped into ffmpeg
  rather than re-probing what ffmpeg wrote, so an encode-side drop could still
  under-report. PRE-EXISTING; close it when the assembly boundary is next opened.
- **`_should_loop_fill` names the permanent fix and it is now being built**
  (`otr_silent_composite.py:244-266`): *"The real fix is phrase-chunking (render the
  beat's correct duration so it never underruns) -- tracked as a follow-up."* The
  coverage block IS that follow-up.
- **THE 7d-PREFLIGHT THAT "PROVED THE GPU" RAN AT THE WRONG CANVAS** (found
  2026-07-27, B5 panel; verified -- and it corrects a claim this file once made).
  `render_single` and both HTTP entry points use the older ledger-free `build_request`,
  which never reaches the canvas seam and defaults to `OTR_VIDEO_RENDER_CANVAS`
  (832x480). So the "GPU IS PROVEN" leg (`ltx_8gb`, 25 frames, 3004 MB) exercised
  832x480, not the production canvas. `render_single` parity is explicitly deferred by
  the O1 judgment; what must NOT happen is another "proof" through that harness being
  read as a production proof. (The 512x288 canvas itself HAS since rendered live --
  bench arm D, three cells -- but through a DIRECT-NODE graph, which proves the canvas
  and the recipe, not the seam.)
- **The ShotLock WRITE-side canvas validation is still owed** (O1 judgment item 1).
  `otr_shot_lock.py` stamps `video.canonical_canvas` unvalidated from a possibly-empty
  policy. B5 made this non-load-bearing for the render (the engine declares its own
  canvas now), so it is no longer urgent -- the drift guard in
  `tests/test_ltx_8gb_canonical_canvas.py` covers the disagreement that matters. Close
  it when the general canvas resolver lands.
- **Odd-canvas evenness is validated at the ENCODER, not where the canvas is chosen.**
  The stride defect itself is closed (`b1f2ee86`): `ffmpeg_silent_mp4_cmd` declares the
  REAL width/height and `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` REFUSES an odd canvas by name,
  because yuv420p subsamples chroma 2x2 and cannot represent an odd dimension. Still
  true and NOT fixed: neither `WanInitImageMixin._dims()` nor the `Canvas` schema
  validates evenness, so an odd canvas is caught late rather than at the choice. No
  live producer builds one today (832x480, 512x288, 1472x832 are all even).
- **`CanonicalClip.frame_count` -- "the integer timing authority" -- HALF CLOSED**
  (`58e288af` + `40780b82`, count closed @ `48e3c6fb` without paying a decode). Every
  module that writes a clip now ffprobes it, and a roster gate in
  `tests/test_terminal_frame.py` fails by name for any module that writes a clip
  without proving it. What this proves and what it does not: it proves the muxer wrote
  what it was piped, which is the right question for a clip written by ONE ffmpeg
  pass; it does NOT prove decodability, which is why `assemble_beat_segments` still
  decode-counts every ASSEMBLED beat and must keep doing so. **Re-verify before
  acting:** this row's "still self-declared elsewhere" pointers (the four `viz_*` and
  four `still_*` engines) were both closed afterwards, so the remaining open surface
  may be empty.
- **KNOWN LIMIT of the widened roster gate**, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a
  surprise: the codec flag is matched as a STRING CONSTANT, so a flag assembled at
  runtime (an f-string, `"-c:%s" % stream`) or the stream-index spelling `-c:0` is
  invisible to the sweep. Nothing in the tree does that today; an encoder that ever
  needs to must be pinned in `_ENTRY_POINT_PROOFS` by hand, which the inventory test
  makes a visible decision. Separately, ONE mutant survives the round by construction:
  deleting the self-proving membership assertion is catchable only by a meta-test of
  that assertion.
- **`ltx_av` underruns long beats** (found 2026-07-25, codex; confirmed). It caps at
  `_LTX_AV_MAX_FRAMES` (`eng_ltx_av.py:58`, default 497, env-overridable) and clamps
  at `:950-953`. It is NOT "renders to target natively" as three earlier docs claimed.
- **Ping-pong on a capped HuMo beat played lip sync BACKWARDS** -- FIXED in code @
  `a1d810f1`, but the finding is STATIC (no live artifact), so it is NOT a PBUG row. A
  capped-14B leg would reproduce it. Kept here so the live proof is not forgotten.
- **`docs/ENGINE_MATRIX.md` reports the DECLARED contract only** (found 2026-07-27).
  Correct today and consistent with its own stated design (every number read from the
  live registry). But the moment a profile pins an `ltx_8gb` ceiling, the matrix keeps
  printing `9-161 step 8` for a tier whose real window is narrower, and the `--check`
  drift gate cannot notice because it diffs the registry, which the effective contract
  never touches. Owed at the prequalification step, not before.

### Routing, env-capture and the credits card

- **`wants_talking_prompt()` escapes any routing freeze.** It calls
  `_recipe_config(self._recipe())` and `_recipe()` (`eng_ltx_av.py:402-432`) re-reads
  `OTR_LTX_AV_RECIPE` / `OTR_LTX_AV_SHARP` / the UNET name on EVERY call by documented
  design ("Read fresh every call"). So a `required="when_engine_talking"` row evaluated
  through the hook re-reads the environment after capture. S0b-core needs ONE shared
  `row_is_active(...)` evaluator over captured state, with the talking result inside
  `ltx_resolved`.
- **`provider_side` is a THREE-part rule, not an attribute.** `_is_cloud_video_engine`
  accepts a `cloud_` id prefix OR the attribute OR `node_key.startswith("cloud_")`.
  `cloud_kling_avatar` has no `provider_side` attribute and is caught by the id prefix
  alone, so an `engine_facts` builder using a bare `getattr` would classify it local
  and let the radio-host redirect send a cloud avatar to local LTX. Needs a regression
  on picked AND forced `cloud_kling_avatar`.
- **Four env-read sites missing from the S0b inventory:** `eng_ltx_video.py:541-564`
  (`OTR_ENABLE_LTX_I2V`), `render_driver.py:1176-1203` and
  `otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:297-300` (`OTR_ENABLE_HUMO_HOSTS`), and
  `eng_ltx_av.py:352-353,403-432` (recipe/UNET re-read outside `assert_usable`).
- **The credits card needs a SMALL-CANVAS VARIANT, and the ladder is not it.** At
  512x288 (the ltx_8gb tier) col1 is 65px past its footer even with every ledger row
  this policy may drop already dropped; at 640x360 it is 12px over. Both are drawn
  anyway (a terminal node never destroys a finished episode) and LOGGED at ERROR
  naming the canvas -- the old behaviour was drawn, clipped by PIL, silent. At 288
  lines the three-column console is already a polite fiction: col3's scrolling
  transcript is as unreadable as anything col1 clips. This is a DESIGN job -- a card
  laid out for a small canvas -- not more ladder heroics.

### Test-harness and tooling

- **The B7 forbidden sweep cannot see an UNTRACKED file, so a new test file passes the
  gate and fails one commit later.** `tests/test_b7_forbidden_sweep.py` builds its
  input from `git diff s29-clean-slate-gate -- *.py`, which covers tracked files only.
  A new test file added and gated in the same session is green; the moment it is
  committed it enters the diff, and a forbidden runtime identifier in it turns HEAD red
  with nothing else changed. Cost one red HEAD. **Not fixed, because the fix is a
  judgment call:** sweeping the working tree instead of the diff would widen the gate
  to every untouched file in the repo. Cheap mitigation until then -- re-run the full
  suite once after the FIRST commit of any new test file.
- **NOTED, not a defect: two `scripts/` bake-off runners now abort a whole sweep on a
  count mismatch.** `scripts/run_ltx_av_q_bakeoff.py:453` and
  `scripts/run_humo_bakeoff.py:660` call the encoder inside per-leg loops with no
  try/except and DISCARD its return value (both set `result["frame_count"]` from
  `int(frames.shape[0])` independently). A disagreement that was previously invisible
  there is now fatal to the run. That is the correct direction -- a lying count is not
  a leg worth finishing -- but a sweep operator should know it before an overnight run.
- **LATENT, not reachable today: the fewest-segments partitioner can accept a
  disproportionate trim on a WIDE discrete menu.** WIRE-W1 makes `partition_beat` take
  the lowest segment count that covers, including via a permitted tail trim. On a
  ladder that is always the right trade; on a DISCRETE menu whose largest entry dwarfs
  its smallest it need not be -- covering 1019 frames from a `(10, 999)` menu, two
  segments give `[999, 999]` and discard 979 frames where three give `[999, 10, 10]`
  exactly. **A bound was written, MEASURED and REVERTED, and the measurement is the
  point:** rejecting a trim of a whole smallest-clip turned `[12, 12]` into
  `[12, 4, 4]` on a `min=4 max=12 quantum=8` ladder -- a third render and a third model
  load to recover four frames -- across 4,885 cases in the sweep grid. The widest
  shipped menus are Veo's `(100, 150, 200)` and Pixverse's `(125, 200)`, whose worst
  real trim is 25 frames. Revisit only if an adapter declares a menu with an extreme
  ratio; the reasoning is recorded in `coverage_plan.partition_beat` so the next reader
  does not re-derive the bound and re-ship the regression.

### Lesson kept because the CLASS matters

- **`eng_wan_i2v` threw away a VRAM peak it measured** -- fixed @ `3acc7fed`. Recorded
  because NEWBUG-1's 2026-07-20 fix landed on `wan_ti2v` and never reached its sibling,
  and nothing caught it for a week because no test drove `wan_i2v.render_clip`'s
  RETURN. **When a receipt fix lands on one adapter, grep the siblings in the same
  change.**

### PARKED -- unverified at HEAD, re-observe AFTER SFX (operator 2026-07-24)

Both were eyeball observations against a story engine that has since had its LLM
vetoes ripped, THE LAW imposed, six banks renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings
retired, the repair-first plan landed, and a ledger cleanup pass added. Neither has a
reproduction at current HEAD, and under the standing rule a finding with no
reproduction is not a row. **Do NOT schedule coder time against either.** They are
settled by the operator eyeballing a real render leg after SFX: still there -> re-admit
as a FRESH dated row with that leg as evidence; gone -> the LAW-era work already fixed
it, tombstone it.

- **Announcer framing defect** (`docs/2026-07-11-announcer-framing-defect.md`).
  Episodes START a story instead of admitting you into one; the announcer takes debate
  turns instead of framing. Operator eyeball 2026-07-11. If it survives re-observation
  the fix is still seam + score contract + fail-closed validator, never Python
  authorship.
- **Name-splice defect #2.** v4-campaign Phase 0 record in HANDOFF_LOG; its timebox
  predates THE LAW.

### Carried administrative rows

- **PBUG-20260710-07** -- root fix shipped; stays ROOT-OPEN in the log until ratified
  at the next operator fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f` is the retire candidate).
- **Phase-2 de-naming** (module filenames, `meta[]` ledger keys, wire-schema `.v4`
  literals) -- DEFERRED, operator-flagged, from the keep-6 rename.

## KNOWN OPEN -- do not rediscover these

* The VRAM admission guard covers coverage-executed beats only; the single-clip path
  returns via `render_shot()` first, and `ltx_audio_in` is not in
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` -- so the hottest-peaking engine is unguarded.
* `FRAME_COST_MODEL` is keyed by engine NAME while recipe/quant/LoRA/reserve are
  env-configurable; a measured row needs a calibration IDENTITY.
* Four adapters still cite missing receipts (`ltx_audio_in`, `mesh_stage`, `viz_green`,
  `viz_mxc_mandala`).
* The HuMo lip-sync onset fix is SPECIFIED but unbuilt, blocked on M1 classification
  (`BUG_BIBLE.yaml:2343`: audio leads the lips by 100-200 ms with the face static for
  the first 3-6 frames). Pre-roll + equal trim is algebraically a NO-OP if the lag is
  constant rather than onset-only, so the classification must come first: early-only ->
  pre-roll fix; constant -> advance the 25 Hz conditioning features; growing -> a
  rate/timestamp bug, not a pad. Run a matched no-LoRA control -- Kijai reports the
  lightx2v distill is not fully HuMo-compatible, so the defect may be ours.
* Cap authority is not yet collapsed to one (`video.max_render_frames` should be sole;
  env twins must be absent-or-equal).
* `otr_w45_campaign.py` runs SIX engines while claiming all local ones, and its
  acceptance would not reject a mirror. Fix before trusting a campaign result.
* The reuse detector cannot separate a deliberately quiet shot from a duplicated frame;
  it is ADVISORY in `otr_w45_campaign.py` until that is solved. The engine-layer and
  composite guards (`MirrorExtensionForbidden`, `ClipUnderrunsItsBeat`) are terminal
  and unaffected.
* `humo_1.7B` and `ltx_8gb` are marked CUDA-only with no fp8, no fp4 and no stated
  reason. Unexamined, not proven.
* M2's raw rows sit in swept `tmp/` with no pinned digest or config manifest.
* `docs/2026-08-02-IDEA-hardware-compatibility-matrix.md` -- captured, not scoped.
  Includes the Mac research: Metal has no `Float8_e4m3fn`, ComfyUI+MPS video is
  impractical (82 min for a 2-second clip), Draw Things and MLX are ~100x faster and DO
  support LTX-2.3 with joint audio, and the `viz_*`/`still_*` lanes need no GPU at all.
* Writer scaffolding repair increments 1-5 (r3-corrected spec in
  `docs/2026-08-03-script-parse-repair-CODE-READY.md`); the reuse detector to the panel;
  section 0A carve-out ruling before M2 numbers move caps; Wan 2.2 I2V checkpoint
  download + `wan_i2v` re-run; the `OTR_CastLock` freeze cascade (`wan_ti2v`); TTS
  parenthetical stripping (documented as BUG-07.12, never wired).

## MEASURED -- the 8 GiB-clamped video bench (2026-07-31, `8bd82efb`)

Kept because several rows above cite it. Nine cells ran live under `--reserve-vram 8`
on the 16 GB card. Arm A: `wan_ti2v` at 832x480, 17 / 49 / 81 frames, all PASS,
peak_delta 6568.2 / 6563.1 / 6563.1 MiB against a 7168 MiB bar. Arm D: `ltx_8gb`
`LTX8_RECIPE_V2` at the shipped 512x288 canvas, 17 / 49 / 81 frames, all PASS,
peak_delta 6691.1 / 6755.3 / 6819.1 MiB. `VramPeakProbe` is machine-wide, which is
exactly why the bench grades on `peak_delta_mib` against each cell's own baseline
rather than the absolute. **Read the scope exactly: that is a PREQUALIFICATION on a
16 GB card told to reserve 8 GiB, not a render on a physical 8 GB card.** Spec and
gates: `docs/2026-07-31-four-arm-clamped-video-bench-SPEC.md`.

## MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET (operator, 2026-07-24 -- read this EVERY window)

Every window states, in its first reply, which rung of this ladder it is on and why.
Pick the cheapest tool that can win; escalate only when the cheaper rung cannot decide.
Both pools reset weekly -- front-load heavy coder windows and big Codex spends early in
the credit week; late-week, drop to the $0 rungs instead of grinding a paid pool dry.

| Rung | Model / tool | Cost | Use for | Never for |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Local Qwen on the 4060 (`10.55.0.2:1234`, LM Studio/ACPX): `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct` | $0 | Read-only FIRST-PASS triage of failures, logs, diffs before any credit spend | Final diagnosis, patches, tests, live qualification; NEVER loaded on the 5080 (ComfyUI renders only) |
| 2 | agy / Antigravity, `KIBITZ_AGY_MODEL="Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)"` (DISPLAY name exactly -- a wrong id silently kills agy and the arc runs codex-only; check antigravity.log per round) | $0 | Default grounded reviewer for ALL mechanical review; panelist on every kibitz | -- |
| 3 | Codex CLI `gpt-5.6-sol` (high) | weekly credits | The second opinion of record: the mandatory kibitz panel, pre-execution grounding of big blocks, live-failure kibitz, HANDOFF_CODEX grind delegation | Verify `codex_model_selected.txt` every arc (a stale skill cache once drifted to gpt-5.5 mid-arc unnoticed) |
| 4 | Claude (Cowork, this) | weekly credits | The actual work: planner + coder windows, anchor/judge on every panel, live-run drive | Babysitting renders (the Codex-app overnight monitor owns that); single-small-item windows (batch per Window packing) |
| 5 | Cloud roundtable (OpenRouter) | real $ | Genuine R1 ideas passes only; <$20 autonomy rule applies | Mechanical/grounding review (that is rungs 2-3) |
| 6 | Fable | scarce | Single final gate on a high-stakes structural change (CLAUDE.md section 9 reality exception) | Anything else |

Production (in-pipeline, all $0/local, offline-first): writers = Mistral-Nemo (ctx cap
16384) + `gemma-4-12b` (saved runtime-qualified local default); stills/video-init =
`z_image_turbo` (the Qwen-Image ENGINE is removed -- keep Qwen3/Qwen2.5 LLM support and
Z-Image's `CLIPLoader(type="qwen_image")` encoder, unrelated). Cloud writers stay
opt-in bake-off arms, never the default.

Per-window mapping: RENDER windows = local production models + the Codex-app monitor,
Claude only to launch and wrap. CODER windows = Claude codes, rung-1 Qwen triages every
failure first, and the full kibitz panel is now mandatory per item (see the ON DECK
gate). PLANNER = Claude + the local panel.

## THE LAW (operator, 2026-07-22 -- supersedes anything that disagrees)

> **AN AUDIT MAY IMPROVE A STORY. IT MAY NEVER FAIL ONE FOR LENGTH, LANGUAGE, STYLE,
> VISUAL VOCABULARY, OR QUALITY.**

The sole terminal spoken-prose policy is the shared whole-word safety authority.
Structural JSON/schema/IDs/roster/source-proof/rights/graph/markup/nonempty/
provider-integrity failures remain fail-closed because they protect a usable ledger
rather than judge prose. Across all six banks, requested word length, actual word
count, drift, one-breath estimates, visual/world vocabulary, noun/POS heuristics,
casing/title/honorific style, craft, and quality are guidance or telemetry only -- they
may never reject, reroll, retire, replace, or block an episode. Same-story LLM cleanup
is allowed.

Note the 2026-08-03 operator directive in `CLAUDE.md` narrows the safety authority
further for EPISODE CONTENT: no profanity or violence filtering on the generation path,
and the source's own language is carried as written on the adaptation lanes.

## Standing operator directives (hard)

* **The recipes are not on the table.** "We spent a lot of time perfecting the recipes
  to look good and we can't lose that." No VRAM, speed or cap finding justifies a recipe
  change; measurement runs the SHIPPED recipe unchanged. This specifically forbids
  reading "peak falls as frames rise" as a reason to raise the 97 trained-length cap,
  and makes the deferred no-LoRA HuMo control a recipe change rather than a control.
* **Per-segment rendering is BY DESIGN** -- "each audio clip takes its own journey, to
  keep VRAM low." Never classify an assembled beat as one render.
* **One coder window in the code at a time**, serialized through this file. Two windows
  editing the same file -- especially the workflow JSON -- is how it gets corrupted.
* The remaining hard rules (root-cause fixes, no content guardrails on generated
  episodes, no word-count chasing, the full-kibitz gate, the ledger-completeness rule
  for any ripped LLM pass, git policy) live in `CLAUDE.md` and are not duplicated here.

## Window packing (credit discipline -- one line starts any window)

Starting any window costs the same boot context, so BATCH chunks per window and never
open one for a single small item. Every window starts by pasting its one-line kickoff --
the `otr-handoff` skill reads this file + git and states the current step. No manual
context handoff, ever. This planner window keeps GO_FORWARD + HANDOFF_LOG current;
coder windows never write plans.

| Window | Scope | Rung | Gate | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CODER (open slot)** | The ON DECK queue at the top of this file, in order, one green pushed chunk at a time, each with its full kibitz | Claude codes + judges; kibitz = codex + agy | none -- work it now | ~2h40m + panels |
| RENDER | PARKED by operator directive 2026-08-04 ("no runs right now"). When it resumes: D2 first, then the WAN/8-GB proof obligations | local production + Codex-app monitor | opens when the operator wants a live leg | GPU days |
| PLANNER | Bug Bible operator fan-out + the `check_compatibility` fork; plan upkeep | rungs 2-4 | parallel with any coder window | docs |

**NEVER boot a window by letter.** Boot by the ON DECK section, always:

> resume the OTR build -- you are a CODER window. Read GO_FORWARD "ON DECK" and execute
> THAT queue only, in its stated order, one green pushed chunk at a time, each with its
> full `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` review per the HARD GATE. State your MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET
> rung first.

### If the window is a REMOTE / cloud Cowork session -- READ THIS FIRST

Learned the hard way 2026-07-26. A Cowork session running IN THE CLOUD is not the same
box as the repo, and two of CLAUDE.md's assumptions do not hold:

- **Read/Write/Edit hit the CONTAINER, not the Windows files.** In a remote window every
  read, edit and write goes through Desktop Commander against
  `C:\Users\jeffr\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-OldTimeRadio`, and so does git,
  the venv python and pytest. Everything else in CLAUDE.md holds.
- **There is a LAGGING Linux snapshot at `/mnt/user-data/uploads/`.** Never read the repo
  through it, and say so explicitly to every subagent -- a prior session's agents
  reported phantom corruption from that mount.
- **The bridge can drop mid-edit.** If the remote-device tools vanish, STOP -- do not
  retry in a loop and do not leave a half-applied edit. Report what is on disk,
  uncommitted, and wait. Nothing was lost when this happened because the last green chunk
  was already pushed, which is the actual argument for pushing every chunk.
- **The 60s MCP call ceiling.** The full suite takes minutes, so launch it detached
  writing to a `tmp/` log + a `.done` marker, then poll. PowerShell `*>` redirection
  writes UTF-16, so read results with `Select-String`.

## Parallel lane -- no coder slot required

- **Bug Bible operator fan-out** -- 9+ closed candidates + the duplicate-legacy_id
  cleanup waiting on one fan-out session.
- **Render-window fillers:** cpu-tier smoke (needs the google image lane or stills) +
  nv50 re-soak -- the two open portability remainders; release QA validation time, not
  coding.
- **SFX R4.1 re-ground** (0.5-1 docs day): re-ground the local generated-SFX R4
  candidate into a tracked current-HEAD R4.1 plan. Sequencing + scope contract live in
  `ROADMAP.md` (Timeline Cue Ledger C0/C1 gate first; no second SFX queue, no library
  fallback).
- **Operator-promotable option:** SFX C0 (per-line WAV stems + transcript drift report)
  is independently shippable per ROADMAP but stays parked unless explicitly promoted.

## Bug Bible promotion field -- pending actions only

| Record | Pending action |
|---|---|
| `PBUG-20260712-22/23/24/25` | Live reverify -- blocked by the `scifi_news` P0 convergence defect, then fan-out |
| `PBUG-20260712-18/19/26` + `PBUG-20260713-15..18` + `-20` | Awaiting the next operator Bible fan-out (overlap check + approval) |
| `PBUG-20260713-19` | Live requalification pending (promoted BUG-05.11) |
| duplicate-id cleanup | Same fan-out: BUG-11.54 legacy_id -> `PBUG-20260713-21`; verify the acronym-union rule's legacy_id (both Bible rows cite `-10`; see the log's renumber note) |
| historical `PBUG-20260711-18` | Keep as a standing context/cap engineering risk; never eligible from static evidence |
| `PBUG-20260710-07` | Ratify retirement at the next fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f`) |

The active production-fix owner updates `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`; the approval queue is
`docs/BUG_BIBLE_PROMOTION_QUEUE.md`; no plan review or invented fixture creates a row.

## Validation and handoff law

- **Current whole-tree receipt (2026-08-04 @ `dcd5a53b`):** full Windows suite
  **8398 passed / 131 skipped / 1 xfailed** (4:07); Bug Bible green. Prior receipts live
  in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` -- this file keeps only the current one.
- Every code chunk: focused tests, full Windows suite, Bug Bible, AST/JSON/BOM/zero-byte
  checks, commit, push, verify `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.
- Every node/widget/link/schema change edits `workflows/otr_canonical.json` in the same
  commit and runs `OTR_WorkflowValidator`, JSON round-trip, strict link/input, live
  widget-vector, and generated-variant audits.
- Reset selectively before every headless run; never blanket-kill Python. Every run loads
  the canonical workflow and writes directly to canonical episode/OBS paths. Asset
  existence, not resident VRAM, proves completion.
- One coder edits code or `workflows/otr_canonical.json` at a time; read-only audits and
  documentation may run in parallel. HANDOFF_LOG + this file are the only tracking
  surfaces.
- **Count the suite on a clean tree:** `build_variants.py --all` also emits variants for
  any UNTRACKED profile on disk, and some profile checks are parametrized over the
  variants present, so another window's scratch profiles can inflate the number by a
  dozen tests that would not reproduce on a fresh clone.

## Open risks

- **NO CLIENT BANK HAS EVER RUN LIVE.** Every extensibility wave is proven by the suite
  and by contract tests, and the first real client bundle is still an unproven path end
  to end (fetch -> interpret -> writer -> cleanup -> tail -> publish). Treat the first
  live client-bank leg as a qualification, not a formality. Deferred power-user tiers
  (client own-runner + staging, dependency manifest, standalone story_rules) are
  explicitly OUT of v1 and are a NEW block if the operator ever wants them.
- **CLIENT-AUTHORED PYTHON executes in-process** (wave 3). The posture that must hold in
  every future change: `--activate` is the consent act; the seam fails LOUD
  (`UserBankExecutionError`) and never substitutes; client code never touches the
  canonical ledger; owner IDENTITY is verified so a bank can only run its OWN bundle; the
  shipped fetcher/interpreter registries are never widened to admit a client id. Do not
  relax any of these for convenience.
- **The client-facing surface is LIVE TEXT, not just docs:** the `custom_source_bank`
  row's `guide_ref` is raised to the operator by `require_runnable_bank`, and the
  `source_bank` tooltip repeats it. Any future change to the activation path (folder
  name, CLI verb, restart behaviour) must update `nodes/story_packs/banks.json`, that
  tooltip and `docs/EXTENDING_OTR.md` together, or the product will confidently instruct
  clients to do the wrong thing.
- **`check_compatibility` is RESERVED, not wired** -- operator/planner decision flagged,
  with a 2-of-2 recommendation to RIP (codex and Fable independently, Claude grounded
  both). The argument that decided it: the "it reserves the name" benefit is FALSE --
  `BUNDLE_ENTRY_ATTRS` constrains what OTR-side code may request from
  `bundle_entry_point()`, it reserves nothing against clients, and activation provably
  ignores whatever a client puts under that name (`tests/test_otr_check_cli.py:335`
  asserts a bundle whose `check_compatibility` is a plain integer activates). The only
  artifact that reserves the name is the `EXTENDING_OTR.md` paragraph, which exists
  either way. Case AGAINST: churn on landed green code for zero behaviour change, and the
  plan of record already names the future consumer (randomizer eligibility). Blast radius
  if ripped: ~5 code sites, 2 test files, 3 docs; no workflow JSON, no routing, no
  source-payload consumer. **Not a coder chunk** -- either ratify the inert constant or
  schedule the rip as a planner chunk. Proposed doctrine line: a name published to
  clients before its consumer exists lives in the client-facing DOC as "reserved, no
  contract, ignored if defined" and nowhere in executable code, because code that names
  an interface is read as enforcing it.
- **The ledger-cleanup pass runs on EVERY bank, not just client banks** (`3d97a130`). It
  is a no-op on a complete ledger and costs no LLM call there, but two shipped-lane
  behaviours did change and are worth watching on the next live legs: (a) unsafe spoken
  language on a `content_owned_readonly` bank is now REPAIRED at the writer tail instead
  of reaching G9 untouched, so a leg that used to die at freeze may now ship a sanitized
  line; (b) a blank `meta.episode_title` is now filled at the tail instead of exploding
  later in `otr_credits_roll`. Both are the intended direction under THE LAW; neither has
  a live receipt yet.
- No code lands mid-sweep of an active qualification campaign (the 420-rung
  uniform-code-confound lesson).
- `dynamic_story` touches the writer, the visual-style authority and the canonical
  workflow; it re-derives the live JSON at build. It is the only claimant on those
  surfaces.
- Generated-SFX R4 stays local/ignored evidence until the tracked R4.1 refit lands; it is
  not an executable queue.
- Lean-mean front/tail drift: the constraint holds wherever it runs -- the tail's SW-1
  re-survey is mandatory against the then-current writer, and the two campaigns never
  share a window.

## Tombstones (do not re-derive; records in HANDOFF_LOG + PROD_BUG_LOG)

Keep-6 bank rename (six de-versioned banks; default `scifi_news`, local/offline-first)

triaged as a batch later; ENGINE_MATRIX survived as a Lean-Mean W6 sub-step; CODER B and
CODER C dissolved with the block) -- **independent client-authored source banks v1** (all
seven waves, CODER E, 2026-07-24 @ `30358ad1`; contract `docs/EXTENDING_OTR.md`) -- the
