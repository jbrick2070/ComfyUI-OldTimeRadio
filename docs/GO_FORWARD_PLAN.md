# OTR Go-Forward Plan

**Forward-only.** Open work, live bugs, standing operator rules, the budget ladder.
Completed work lives in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` (newest at top) and every prior
revision of this file is in git. If a thing is DONE, it does not belong here.

## ON DECK -- WHAT REMAINS OF CONTINUITY CORRECTNESS

### 1. The reference A/B still owes a verdict (the one real open item)

The reference path is PROVEN WIRED, not proven EFFECTIVE. Live leg
`signal_lost_lute_strings_fools_tongue_20260805_021040` shows three `scene_character`
rows stamped `portrait_anchor_mode='reference_latent'`, and the two rows sharing char
`c03` share one anchor -- so the engine declared the capability, the portrait row
resolved, the file was on disk, and the anchor entered the cache key.

**What nobody has answered: does `z_image_turbo_nvfp4` actually ATTEND to the prepended
reference, or does it accept and ignore it?** The architecture takes it with no missing
weights (header probe: `cap_pad_token` and `x_pad_token` present, `siglip_embedder`
absent), but graph shape cannot prove three faces became one. That needs:
- a control arm with **`OTR_PORTRAIT_REFERENCE=0`**, on its own fresh server boot --
  env vars cannot reach a resident ComfyUI process, and `OTRImageGenDispatcher` has no
  `IS_CHANGED` to notice the flag, so the arms MUST NOT share a boot;
- the control asserts `portrait_anchor_mode == 'seed'`, NOT `''`. The seed pin is still
  enabled in that arm. Only setting BOTH `OTR_PORTRAIT_REFERENCE=0` and
  `OTR_PORTRAIT_IDENTITY_SEED=0` yields `''`;
- an operator eyeball on the two arms, which is the actual verdict.

If the reference turns out to be a no-op, **Track 2 Step 8 (flux2_klein)** is the built
answer -- klein is genuinely reference-trained and its weights are on disk. It is
deliberately NOT built yet. Switching to it is a Director widget pick, not code.

### 2. Operator calls nobody can make for you

- **ARIEL and PUCK.** The curated supplement ships 10 entries and deliberately omits
  these two: Folger's stage directions use "he" for both, but neither has a roster fact
  and both are editorial. They stay on the roll, so the corpus gate asserts 40 of 42.
  Say the word and they become 42.
- **Tier floor 2 or 3.** Shipped at 2: it removes every 100% voice pin while 5 of 24
  (engine x gender x timbre) combos still honour the requested timbre. Floor 3 also
  removes them but leaves only 2 of 24 honouring timbre -- it buys spread by deleting the
  dimension. `OTR_CAST_MIN_TIER_POOL=3` makes it a one-leg A/B, and the floor is folded
  into the cast seed so the two settings can never both claim policy '3'.
- **`num_characters` is still 2.** Every published adaptation ran 2, so a 7-speaker scene
  loses five people. Correct gender for two survivors is still a truncated scene. This
  collides with the count-match invariant at `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4119` and is its
  own piece of work, not a tail of this one.

### 3. Standing facts worth not re-deriving

`slot.gender` is NOT a voice field. It feeds the description LLM
(`_otr_casting.py:777`), the outline prompt (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4144`), the
dialogue cast block (`_otr_line_composer.py:446`) and the image prompt's gender anchor
(`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:78-90`). **The gender fix therefore changes scripts and
portraits.** That is a downstream consequence of a correctness fix, not a violation of
the closed story-quality directive -- exactly as "Malvolio speaks with a woman's voice"
is a bug while rewriting his dialogue is not.

Do NOT feed pinned genders into `prior_genders`, and do NOT re-call
`_plan_gender_distribution` with a reduced count. Measured: `(1, ['male'])` returns
female 400/400, and the shuffle's stream consumption varies with count (getrandbits
0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 11 for counts 0..5). The shipped design overrides in place and leaves the
allocator untouched.

**Source-grounding sprint, the one piece left:** chunk 3b-ii -- the supply line
that feeds grounding into the writer -- is BUILT-BUT-UNWIRED and PARKED under the
story-quality directive. The delivery mechanism exists and nothing calls it. A
contributor may pick it up; chunk detail under THE CODING SPRINT item 1.

## THE CODING SPRINT (operator directive 2026-08-04; re-sized by the r1-r4 arc)

Item 1 is the structural work and consumes most of a session; items 2-3 are
small and share one campaign. TWO campaigns: item 1; items 2+3.

**RENDERS HAVE RESUMED** (2026-08-05). The 08-04 "no render runs this session"
line is spent -- it governed that session only, and the 08-05 handoff opens on a
live-proof obligation. Reset per `CLAUDE.md` section 4 before any leg: selective
CIM kill by CommandLine, never a blanket python kill (it severs the MCP tooling).

Everything below was verified against the real files on 2026-08-04, is
non-GPU, and is provable by the suite alone. Work them in order; each ends
green and pushed on its own.

### HARD GATE FOR THIS SPRINT -- NO CODE SHIPS WITHOUT A FULL KIBITZ (operator directive 2026-08-04)

Operator: "for the next coding sprint be sure any coding work has a full
`/kibitz-plugin:kibitz` review." **This is a gate, not a suggestion.** Now also
written into `CLAUDE.md` above the two-strikes rule, because that older rule says
a first-try root fix does not need a panel and would otherwise win the conflict.

* **FULL = the default four-round arc.** r1 arc -> r2 coding -> r3 wiring -> r4
  convergence; 8 external calls (two reviewers x four rounds). Not a scoped tail,
  not one round, not a continuation receipt. If a round genuinely cannot run, say
  which one and why -- a partial campaign is NEVER reported as a full arc.
* **Invoke `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` by name.** `anthropic-skills:kibitz` is the
  older duplicate; it is not what was asked for.
* **Panel = Codex + Antigravity.** Claude drives from Cowork, so the driver's own
  family is excluded -- do not launch a second `claude -p` lane against yourself.
* **Use the ComfyUI profile.** `.kibitz/comfyui.local.md` is already in the repo
  (written 2026-07-11). Regenerate via `kibitz/scripts/comfyui_profile.py` if the
  tree has moved past it. Node contract, widget/`widgets_values` drift and
  `IS_CHANGED` are exactly the defect classes this sprint can produce.
* **Anchor first, judge last.** Write `driver_anchor.md` from the REAL Windows
  files (Desktop Commander -- never the lagging Linux mount) BEFORE the fan-out,
  then ground every panel claim and discard the misreads. A panel run on a false
  premise is worse than no panel.
* **When it binds:** the campaign runs on the item's plan BEFORE the code, and its
  MUST-FIX list is answered BEFORE the commit. The panel does not replace the
  suite and the suite does not replace the panel -- both, every item.
* **Batching (amended by the r1 panel, 2026-08-04):** item 1 gets its OWN
  campaign covering its 2-3 chunks -- it is the structural change and precisely
  what a panel is for. Items 2 + 3 SHARE ONE campaign over their combined diff:
  every item still passes through a full arc (the directive is satisfied), but a
  fixture-isolation chunk does not buy 8 external calls of wall-clock on its own.
  This batching is the gate-compliant reading, not an exemption.
* **Artifacts:** `kibitz-runs/<date>-<topic>/r<N>/` with the per-round
  `input.md`, `driver_anchor.md`, reviewer files, `judgment.md`, `final.md`.
  UTF-8, no BOM. (r4 fixed a conflict here -- this matches the standing
  re-ground gate's location and the tool's actual output; the earlier
  `docs/<date>-<topic>/kibitz/` line is withdrawn.)

Kibitz is CPU/API only and costs the operator nothing, so it never competes with
work for the GPU -- but it does cost wall-clock. Four campaigns is real time on
top of the ~2h40m of coding below. If the session runs short, finish FEWER items
fully reviewed rather than more items unreviewed.

### 1. THE PUBLIC_DOMAIN LANE IS TOLD TO CARRY WORDS IT IS NEVER SHOWN (the session's main work -- r1 panel re-scoped 2026-08-04)

The headline defect, and the one that manufactured "Arkham, Massachusetts" over
H. G. Wells. The pack orders the model to carry the author's language:

* `nodes/story_packs/public_domain/faithful_radio_adaptation.json:13`
  (`exchange_system`) -- "Where the source gives these characters words, CARRY
  THEM. Keep their diction, their rhythm, their argument."

And `nodes/_otr_compose_exchange.py` (994 lines) has **ZERO** references to
`source_text`, `full_text`, `source_meta` or `excerpt` -- verified by grep.
**The instruction is bound to an absent document.** A model told to carry words
it cannot see will invent words and believe it complied.

**SCOPE RULING (r1, grounded against `docs/2026-08-03-fidelity-pass-ownership.md`
line 25): this item is PUBLIC_DOMAIN ONLY.** The ownership table rules
`exchange_compose` **NOT RUN** on the Shakespeare verbatim lane ("It exists to
author dialogue. There is no dialogue to author."), so enhancing the composer
for Shakespeare invests in a pass the verbatim executor removes. Shakespeare
gets exactly ONE change this sprint: its dangling comma (item 3). The keystone
"compile source speech, do not generate it" (THE ADAPTATION DESIGN) binds the
VERBATIM lane; `public_domain` is the operator-ruled FUZZY PROSE lane, where
grounding the generative composer is the correct move, not a contradiction.

Three legs, ALL required -- the panel killed the raw-injection shape:

**(a) A BOUNDED source window over the COMPLETE canonical body -- never the
payload's `full_text`, which is itself truncated.** r2 correction of this
plan's own premise: `canonicalize_public_domain_text(..., max_chars=12000)`
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:337-343`) truncates at 12,000 CHARS, and
`payload_from_manifest_unit` stores THAT as `full_text` -- while the corpus
runs **916 words (`cradle_protocol`) to 25,200 words (`beckoning_fair_one`)**
across 65 units. So "the material already arrives, it needs passing" is false
for large sources: the payload carries a prefix. The selector reads the
complete canonical body from the SOURCE layer, separated from the interpreter
excerpt. Hash discipline: exactly ONE of 65 units ships a provenance sidecar
(`time_machine__arrival.provenance.json`), and its `body_sha256` covers
normalized RAW bytes, not the canonicalized body -- two NON-interchangeable
fields. Derive a `canonical_body_sha256` at fetch/selection time, bind
selection + receipts to it, and do NOT call it authenticated provenance. Do
NOT migrate the 65 closed manifests for it (`_SOURCE_KEYS`/`_UNIT_KEYS` closed
at `:48-63`); carry it in `source_meta` and snapshots. Coordinate system (r3):
refactor `canonicalize_public_domain_text` into an UNCAPPED normalization
owner plus a separate 12,000-char legacy payload projection; spans are
half-open Unicode char offsets (`start_char`/`end_char`) into the uncapped
string; `canonical_body_sha256 = sha256(canonical_body.encode("utf-8"))`;
stamp normalization + selector versions. Transport (r3): `SourceFetchResult`
exposes only payload/source_meta/source_rights and `_resolve_inputs` collapses
to a three-tuple, and the snapshot envelope is the SEVEN-KEY payload
(`_otr_source_snapshot.py:48-50`) whose `full_text` is the truncated prefix --
so extend the PUBLIC-DOMAIN snapshot with the CANONICAL BODY as the SOLE
replay authority (r4 cut the "or exact selected text" alternative -- selected
text cannot recreate pre-outline grounding or select windows for a NEWLY
generated outline), under a versioned body/hash/normalization contract. A
legacy seven-key snapshot FAILS with a typed grounding-version error -- but
ONLY when the snapshot's bank is `public_domain`/adaptation (r4, both lanes
converged): the seven-key envelope is the UNIVERSAL loader, and an
unconditional rejection would break every other bank's existing snapshots and
bake-off replays. Keep the full document OUT of meta/ledger (`source_meta` is
copied into durable metadata at `:3548`). Budget: capacity
is EVERY backend, not GGUF alone -- the fitting seam
(`_otr_generation_budget.py:132`) spans GGUF (`estimate_prompt_tokens`,
estimator, `_otr_gguf_backend.py:1264-1273`), OpenRouter, Google and Comfy --
so select the window against the COMPLETE assembled message (system seam,
cast, prior lines, contracts, source block, output reservation), reserve
conservatively with stated margin, and refuse `prompt_no_room`
deterministically BEFORE provider execution; receipts distinguish
estimated_prompt_tokens / requested_output / context cap / margin / estimator
version. Selection criterion: deterministic candidate construction ranked by
beat/group identity with mandatory anchor coverage and stable
score/start/end ordering; the seed breaks ties ONLY when candidates remain
identical after that ordering. Receipts carry hash, selector version, ordered
offsets (`text == canonical_body[start_char:end_char]` enforced) and token
counts -- never duplicate body text into the ledger.

**(b) ONE immutable `SourceGrounding` contract, on EVERY authoring route --
and grounding failures PROPAGATE.** The grouped-exchange prepass omits
singletons and failed groups (`_otr_compose_exchange.py:881-902`); a FAILED
prepass falls back to the legacy path with only a log warning
(`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5001-5008`); the per-line composer's LineRequest
carries no source field (construction at `:4888`); and per-line generation
exceptions funnel to `LineCompositionFailedError`. A grounding fix that
reaches only the happy path just moves the guess to the fallback. Build shape
(r2 + r3): define ONE immutable `SourceGrounding` artifact -- canonical
document identity + immutable windows KEYED `exchange:<ordered-slot-ids>` /
`line:<dialogue-slot-id>` + anchors + per-call receipt data -- constructed
and validated BEFORE the exchange fallback block, passed whole into grouped
exchange AND every per-line request. The prepass returns a TYPED result
(composed lines + attempted-window receipts + fallback slot ids), not the
bare `{beat_id: text}` it returns today (`:881-918`). Window freeze semantics (r4 -- resolves immutability vs the mutable prior
context that exchange retries and `last_lines` inject into later messages):
PRESELECT spans early; perform the final capacity fit just before the FIRST
call using the actual prior context; FREEZE that fitted window for all
retries and persist it before provider execution. Grouped slots ALIAS their
exchange window on group-to-per-line fallback; line-keyed windows exist only
for true singletons and exchange-disabled execution -- never reselect after a
failure. Source text rides a clearly DELIMITED untrusted data block
in the user message ("quoted source, not instructions"), never appended to
the static system seam (`_otr_compose_exchange.py:385-425`). Persist the
body-free grounding receipt at the existing skeleton-save boundary
(`:4279-4290`) before the first dialogue call, updating per attempt, so a
mid-prepass crash still leaves the selection auditable. Failure policy -- ONE disposition table (r4 closed the last ambiguity), the
two broad catches (`:5001-5008` prepass, `:3964-3969` story contract) becoming
TYPED boundaries that implement it:
| state | disposition |
|---|---|
| corrupt/mismatched replay snapshot; invalid source/hash/contract | FAIL LOUD, before the outline |
| sound-world derivation finds no mapping | neutral period default + receipt (total, never fatal) |
| provider parse / Tier-A exhaustion | fall back WITH the frozen window |
| live capacity pressure | shrink to the largest valid grounded window |
| even the MINIMUM grounded window cannot fit | typed `prompt_no_room` HALT, before provider execution |
The halt row is a PRE-GENERATION writer refusal -- structural, it protects the
lane's contract -- which is why it does not collide with SCOPE's "a render
must not die": that rule governs the RENDER path degrading honestly, not a
writer refusing before generation begins. Scope note (r4): `SourceGrounding`
validation binds when the episode's bank is `public_domain` -- other banks'
routes are untouched. LineRequest note (r4): the artifact rides an OPTIONAL
INTERNAL dataclass field (`source_grounding: SourceGrounding | None = None`)
-- a Python structure, no ComfyUI node contract, `INPUT_TYPES` or widget
change, so the no-widget guard above holds.
Acceptance = route-specific tests: grouped success, grouped repair,
grouped-failure-to-per-line, singleton, exchange-disabled legacy, snapshot
replay (new envelope AND legacy-envelope typed refusal, public_domain-scoped),
hash mismatch, exact-capacity rejection -- plus a corpus-wide property test
over all 65 units proving normalization idempotence, canonical-hash stability
and `text == body[start_char:end_char]` for every emitted span (r4). Version
discipline (r4): the existing constants are `PROMPT_VERSION =
"public_domain_interpreter_v2"` / `SCHEMA_VERSION = "public_domain_briefs_v1"`
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:36-38`); name and bump every changed one, and
give SourceDocument / SourceOverview / SourceGrounding / normalization /
selector / snapshot their own explicit versions.

**(c) World anchors, DERIVED FIRST -- and the sound world gets ONE owner that
feeds every surface.** Prefer deriving a typed grounding sidecar from EXISTING
metadata + the selected spans. New manifest fields are a LAST resort:
`_SOURCE_KEYS`/`_UNIT_KEYS` are closed frozensets
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:48-63`, same for `_SCENE_KEYS`), so new fields
mean a schema version + migration across all 65 units. AND the competing frame
must actually be disabled, not outvoted: the adaptation `sound_world` is a
content-blind draw (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3962`, palettes at
`_otr_style_catalog.py:442-463` -- grate/mantel/teacup over whatever source
rolled it). r2 sharpened the shape: the catalog renders the drawn sound world
into `contract.grammar` SEPARATELY from the `contract.sound_world` stamp and
the canon derivation, so a stamp-only fix leaves the prompt grammar still
carrying the contradictory palette. ONE source-aware derivation function must
feed the stamp, the grammar and canon for `style_pool_class == "adaptation"`
(arc_shape gate at `:4325` is the shipped precedent), with an explicit neutral
period default when no mapping exists -- and it runs BEFORE the grammar is
built (or the grammar re-renders from the final contract), or the prompt
grammar keeps the contradictory palette while the stamp looks fixed (r3, both
lanes independently). DECIDE whether derivation failure is fatal: today's
broad catch silently disables the whole story contract. Reconcile with the
EXISTING anchors owner: `meta["specificity_anchors"]`
(`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4259-4266`) already derives and injects an anchor
projection -- the new source anchors REPLACE it or deterministically merge
into it, never run beside it as a second independent voice. Do NOT delete the
adaptation styles -- operator-authored 2026-07-14; fix the DRAW and the
plumbing, not the styles.

**Two receipts, named now so neither is overstated later:**
* `code-complete + suite-green` -- the most this no-render session can claim.
* `production-qualified` -- only after a canonical `public_domain` leg passes a
  rubric: no unsupported foreign place/character/object; the source's setting
  and principal event retained; provenance receipt complete; `obs_publish OK`;
  asset on disk.

**Two rules from the 08-03 craft brief, both hard-won, both easy to violate:**
1. **Never name the feared failure.** Writing "no Arkham" into a prompt IMPLANTS
   Arkham. Forbid by CATEGORY, never by example.
2. **Every fidelity instruction must be PAIRED with the material it binds to.**
   An unpaired "carry the words" is the bug, not the fix.

**Size honesty (r1) and CHUNK ORDER (r3 -- the naive order was CYCLIC):** this
is THE SESSION, not 90 minutes. r3 caught a dependency cycle in the obvious
build order: the sound world feeds `contract.grammar`, the grammar is consumed
by the OUTLINE (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3948-3963` -> `:4129`), and beats do
not exist until the outline returns -- so a sound world derived from
beat-keyed windows is impossible. Build in THIS order, one green pushed chunk
each:
**CHUNKS 1 AND 2 ARE DONE AND PROVEN ON RENDERS. CHUNK 3 IS NEXT.**

**Carried into chunk 3 from the chunk-2 QA (do not lose):** snapshot replay
has no whole-body carrier, so an adaptation lane replaying a frozen source
falls back to the drawn palette and a live run and its replay produce
different sound worlds. The tempting fix -- rebuild the document from the
snapshot's `full_text` -- is WRONG and was rejected: that field is the
truncated projection, so it would mint a document whose total-coverage
guarantee describes a prefix. The correct fix is the snapshot-envelope
extension already specified in 1(a) below.

1. **Uncapped `SourceDocument` + a pre-outline `SourceOverview`** (r4): split
   the normalization owner, then derive deterministic COVERING windows with
   exact-span evidence for cast, setting, principal turns and ending. This is
   what grounds the PRE-OUTLINE authors -- the interpreter today reads the
   CAPPED payload (`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:520-543`, running at
   `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3748-3757`) before contract (`:3948`) and
   outline (`:4129`); beat-keyed grounding alone arrives too late for them.
   Transport (r4): ONE transient typed field --
   `SourceFetchResult.source_document` -> typed normalized result ->
   `resolved["source_document"]` -- MECHANICALLY excluded from meta/ledger
   serialization; snapshot replay reconstructs the same type.
2. **Contract / grammar / outline from the overview's document-level
   anchors**: the one derivation function runs BEFORE grammar build (or
   grammar re-renders from the final contract), feeding stamp + grammar +
   canon. Pre-outline derivation uses DOCUMENT-level anchors only -- selected
   spans do not exist yet (r4 wording fix).
3. **Beat-keyed window selector + `SourceGrounding` threading + typed failure
   boundaries** (post-outline, when beats exist). The route matrix must NAME
   the announcer routes -- intro / rewrite / outro authoring at
   `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5104-5116`, `:5272-5285`, `:5357-5409`
   (verify-at-build) -- and decide per route: grounded, or constrained to
   already-grounded accepted fields.
No node signature, widget, link or schema change is intended anywhere in this
item -- the canonical JSON stays byte-identical through the sprint; if any
chunk turns out to need an INPUT_TYPES change, section-0 same-commit rules
apply and the plan must say so first. The bench items were conditional filler
and are now unreachable; that is fine.

**Ceiling to be honest about:** this can be built and unit-tested here, but its
real proof is a render, and renders are parked. Ship `code-complete +
suite-green` and say so; `production-qualified` waits for the leg.

### 2. THE NON-COMMERCIAL NOTICE REACHES NO HUMAN SURFACE (~30 min)

Fully scoped, ledger-clean, and the smallest real win on the board.
`nodes/OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3590` stamps `meta["noncommercial_notice"]` (via
`_otr_provenance.noncommercial_notice`, `:124`) and logs it. **Nothing renders
it.** `nodes/otr_credits_roll.py:516` reads only `credits_source_line`.

Add a sibling printed-credits item beside that block -- `:516-518` is the exact
three-line shape to copy -- plus an integration test. The ledger field already
exists and already has an owner, so this adds a CONSUMER, not a field: no
ownership question to answer. Fires on Folger sources.

**Acceptance (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4):** `meta.noncommercial_notice` present -> ONE
rendered credits item; absent when empty, exact text, exactly ONCE. The
existing source item renders as `>> SOURCE: ...` (`otr_credits_roll.py:510-518`)
-- state the notice's literal prefix the same way, and the notice renders even
when a malformed legacy ledger lacks `credits_source_line`; ADJACENCY (source
line immediately followed by the notice, each its own `intercept` entry)
applies when both exist. No new wrapping helper: the existing intercept renderer already
measures and wraps every entry through `_wrap`
(`otr_credits_roll.py:1131-1135`). Test the ORDERED flow list (do not convert
`col3_flow` to a dict -- duplicate `"intercept"` keys collapse). Integration
fixture proves the Folger wording survives flow construction unchanged.
Legibility on canvas is eyeballed on the next permitted render, not claimed
from the test.

### 3. THE TEST-ORDERING POLLUTION (~30 min)

`tests/test_public_domain_sources.py` pollutes
`tests/test_public_domain_interpreter.py::test_empty_cast_is_rejected_and_retried_to_failure`.
Confirmed 2026-08-04: fails when the two run adjacently, passes **11/11** when
the interpreter file runs alone, invisible in full-suite order. Pre-existing --
already proven by stashing and reproducing at the prior commit.

Worth the half hour because it costs a real signal: any targeted run touching
those two files reports a red line that has to be re-diagnosed as benign every
time. **Build shape (r2 -- the r1 "cleanup fixture" idea was WRONG and is
withdrawn):** the mechanism is MODULE-IDENTITY breakage, not leaked state.
`test_module_import_is_lazy` (`tests/test_public_domain_sources.py:223-233`)
calls `importlib.reload(pd)` twice, which REPLACES the module's class objects,
while the interpreter test file imported exception classes at collection time
-- so `except OldClass` no longer matches instances raised by the reloaded
module. No cleanup fixture can restore class identity. Fix (r3-refined): run
the lazy-import assertion in a SUBPROCESS -- `sys.executable`, repo-root
`cwd`, `check=True`, fresh import with the read guard installed -- and pin
BOTH test-order permutations as regressions. The private-module-name
alternative is CUT: it risks exercising fallback import paths instead of the
production `nodes._otr_public_domain_sources` package identity.

### 4. FINISH ITEM 7 -- the leak is closed and proven; testability is not (~2h)

The spoken-citation defect SHIPPED and is live-proven (`3943dd38`, `0957e169`,
`104c3f78`; receipt in `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` PBUG-20260805-04). Seven legs, six lanes,
zero leaked lines, and the corpus audit held at 69 findings across eight new
episodes. Licensed sources are now credit-only -- the announcer names neither the
licence nor the licensor, because Folger publishes the edition and Shakespeare
wrote the play.

What it still owes, all specified in `kibitz-runs/2026-08-05-item7-citation/r4/final.md`:

* **B4 -- extract the coda helper** so tests exercise the production reader.
  **TRAP:** do NOT extract `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5463-5588` verbatim.
  `news_meta` is defined inside that range and read by the caller below it --
  extracting as written is a `NameError` on every episode. Both review lanes
  caught this independently. Keep `news_meta` in the caller.
* **B6 -- bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`** (`nodes/_otr_ledger.py:58`). The audit
  must REQUIRE `spoken_coda_source` on post-fix ledgers while tolerating its
  absence on the 1,587 legacy ones; without a version boundary a dropped receipt
  is indistinguishable from history. `LEGACY_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` in
  `scripts/audit_spoken_citations.py` is already written to expect the bump.
* **Writer-level routing tests** (depend on B4): both fidelity banks x
  {non-empty, empty} provenance, plus an owned/non-empty case with
  `_style_grammar_on == False`. Assert the coda is PRESENT, not merely that the
  URL is absent. Control is `media_archive`, NEVER `scifi_news` -- that lane
  dispatches to `scifi_news_circuit` and returns before this block.
* **Bug Bible coverage** -- mandatory per `CLAUDE.md`, not a judgment call. The
  rule to promote: **a fix applied to a function with no callers is not a fix.**
  The 2026-08-04 attempt at this same defect edited `spoken_coda_line()`, which
  had zero readers, and 30 episodes leaked after it "landed".

Also parked and owed a merge: another session's worktree
`.claude/worktrees/awesome-brahmagupta-a509b4` holds the uncommitted deletion of
the dead `news_coda_spoken_reduction` receipt chain and `finalize_news_coda_surface`
(no callers tree-wide, no producer for its two trigger flags). It stood down so it
would not collide with B4. Re-ground it against the new helper boundary, then merge.

### 5. 1,090 CAST ROWS CLAIM A NON-COMMERCIAL MODEL IS COMMERCIALLY CLEAN

`eng_indextts2.py:55` says `commercial_clean = False` (bilibili non-commercial);
all 40 bank rows say `true`; `cast_lock.py` trusts the bank row. The row flag is
the CLIP's licence and the engine flag is the MODEL's -- genuinely different
facts, both already in the right layers. **Stamp the JOIN. Do NOT edit the 40
bank rows** (`otr_dl_indextts2_refs.py:11-17` documents them as clip provenance;
the ingest mints three rows across three engines from one PD clip).

**Must heal ATOMICALLY or it creates the defect it fixes:** the stamp
(`cast_lock.py:742`), the `gated` counter (`:575/:614/:661/:670`) AND the three
report strings (`:578/:618/:673`) -- otherwise the report prints `clean=True`
beside a ledger saying `False`. Resolve ONE profile by `(role, engine)` --
role-scoped, never engine-name-scoped. **Enforcement stays OFF.**
Prospective-only for the 1,090 frozen ledgers.

### 6. A TERMINAL FREEZE GATE THAT HAS NEVER READ A POPULATED FIELD

`find_scene_coherence_issues` reads `lines[].scene_id`; the `scifi_news` lane
writes `beats[].scene_id`. 55 ledgers assert the check, 0 carry the field, 55
pass. Nothing in `nodes/` writes `lines[].scene_id` on ANY lane -- the check
never had a producer.

Join per line: `beat_id` -> beat -> `scene_id` -> declared scene. Add a **VACUITY
refusal** (an armed gate that examined zero linkages FAILS -- that is how this
survived 55 episodes). **Split request from verdict:** keep a
configuration-derived `scene_coherence_required` and write
`{required, checked, verdict, issues}` into `report.info` -- `run_gap_audit` is
READ-ONLY (`_otr_ledger_freeze.py:664-698`), so the gate must not mutate the
ledger; the phase wrappers already persist the report. Measure OFFLINE over the
published corpus first, then arm in ONE change -- no intermediate flag-off ship.
Replace the stale hard-coded bank list at `tests/test_scene_guard_v4.py:89-99`
with registry-derived coverage (it omits `scifi_news`, the one bank that enables
the flag).

**The vacuity class is now proven twice** -- this gate, and the freeze test at
`test_g9_sfw_ship_stop.py` that filtered on a retired code prefix (fixed
`4506b1ed`). Any NEW armed gate ships with a vacuity assertion.

### 7. CHARACTER GENDER IS ROLLED ON PROSE LANES -- Scrooge shipped female (spec written, Codex r2 returned NO)

Live 2026-08-05: `EBENEZER SCROOGE` = female, `JACOB MARLEY` = other,
`HENRY HARTWICK OGLETHORPE` = female. Meanwhile MACBETH, BANQUO, PROSPERO and
MIRANDA are all correct.

**The split IS the diagnosis, and it means the render code is not broken.**
Shakespeare ships 14 provenance sidecars carrying `characters` with genders; the
prose lane has ONE tracked sidecar and its `characters` key is `None`. The pin
chain already exists and is lane-neutral (`_otr_roster_gender.py`, 12.6 KB, on
disk). Shakespeare is right because the DATA is there. Prose is rolled because it
is not. **This is a vendor-time data gap with a working consumer** -- the exact
inverse of the Item 7 bug, where the value existed and nothing read it.

Spec: `docs/2026-08-05-character-gender-ladder-SPEC.md` (Fable, driver-grounded).
A four-tier TOTAL ladder -- roster -> pronouns in the source text ->
character-in-work web lookup -> name-frequency percentage -- stamping `gender`
(always populated, never `unknown`, because a voice must still be cast) plus
`gender_source` and a confidence. Operator rulings baked in: Shakespeare's KNOWN
rows are untouchable, the announcer stays randomly male/female by design, and the
invented lanes (`original`, `scifi_news`, `scifi_news_pro`, `media_archive`) keep
rolling -- their characters do not exist, so a name search there risks matching a
real person.

**Codex r2 verdict: NO. Eleven must-fixes, at `kibitz-runs/2026-08-05-gender-ladder/r2/codex.md`.**
The diagnosis survived; the mechanism did not. The three that matter:

1. **The web search would silently do nothing.** The spec passes a tools/plugins
   argument to `OpenRouterBackend.generate`, which swallows unknown kwargs through
   `**_ignored` -- no error, no search, a confident answer from a model that never
   looked. That is the same silent-no-op class as the defect above.
2. **"LLM extraction over the FULL unit text" cannot run.** `beckoning_fair_one.txt`
   is 143,176 bytes and 58 of 65 source files exceed 12,000 bytes, against a
   32,768 estimated-token per-call cap.
3. **Blanket surname aliases are identity-unsafe.** Two rows sharing a surname
   with the same gender currently produce a confident pin rather than an
   abstention.

**Next step is r3 on the spec, not code.**

**Found while grounding, and it reopens an operator ruling:** 32 of 85 Shakespeare
roster rows are `unknown` TODAY -- 38% of the lane assumed solved. Comedy of Errors
ships 7 characters, every one unknown. The narrower ruling that fits the evidence:
Shakespeare's KNOWN rows stay untouchable, but tiers 3-4 may fill only its
`unknown` rows. That fixes 32 rows without ever second-guessing a parsed
dramatis personae. **Operator decision, not a driver call.**

### 8. THE VOICE AND THE PORTRAIT MUST MATCH THE GENDER -- outranks item 7 (operator ruling 2026-08-05)

**Operator, and this reorders the board:** "I am fine with LLMs trying to choose
the best gender as long as they choose one and pick a voice that matches and
portrait matches." And: "the voice and picture must match, that most important."

**CONSISTENCY BEATS ACCURACY.** A female Scrooge with a female voice and a female
portrait is a coherent episode that is merely unfaithful to Dickens. A male
Scrooge with a female reference voice is a BROKEN episode. So item 7 raises
fidelity; this item protects coherence, and coherence ships first.

The gender value already fans out to three surfaces -- the voice, the portrait
prose (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:78-90`, the gender anchor) and the script.
The defect is that one of them does not follow it.

* **`voice_ref_id` ignores the resolved gender.** Across three episodes the preset
  follows the roll every time and the reference never does: `bm_george` + `bf_emma`,
  and in another episode the exact reverse (`bf_emma` + `bm_fable`). A single-source
  bug, and AUDIBLE in the finished episode. **Fix this first.**
* **The portrait must be proven to follow too.** Wheel of Wrath's description says
  "her left cheek" for a character the ledger genders male -- so the portrait prose
  tracks something, and it needs the same consistency assertion as the voice.
* **Two gender vocabularies.** `scifi_news` emits `Male` / `Female` / `Non-binary`
  while every other lane emits `male` / `female` / `other`. Any consumer matching
  on that string breaks on one of them -- including any consistency check written
  against the wrong casing.

**The acceptance test this item exists for:** for every cast row in a finished
episode, `gender`, the voice preset, the voice reference and the portrait's gender
anchor all agree. That invariant is checkable offline over the published corpus,
exactly like `scripts/audit_spoken_citations.py`, and it does not care whether the
gender is the historically correct one.

### Bench leftovers (relocated)

The old conditional bench block is gone (unreachable once item 1 grew, and two
of its three items already live in NEXT CODING QUEUE item 6). The remaining
one: **the three works that refuse to vendor** (`ghost_ship` gid 11045,
`purple_cloud` 11229, `beleaguered_city` 11521 --
`scripts/otr_vendor_public_domain_library.py:303/341/542` against the parser
at `:594-686`) **needs one Gutenberg fetch, so it is operator-opt-in only** --
not schedulable inside an offline sprint.

**Do NOT start the Shakespeare verbatim executor in this session.** It is a
multi-session structural change gated on the ownership table
(`docs/2026-08-03-fidelity-pass-ownership.md`) with four overwrite paths to close
first, and starting it half-way is worse than not starting it.

## NEXT CODING QUEUE -- confirmed against the tree 2026-08-04 (non-GPU, suite-provable)

Verified by grep/read this session, after the operator parked SFX and asked what
other coding work is real. Same rules as ON DECK: in order, one green pushed
chunk at a time, full `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` per item while the sprint gate
stands.

1. **Style/identity campaign, items 1-4 (one campaign, ~1 day).** Highest
   leverage: fixes the credits style line for all six banks uniformly.
   Re-verified: `run_story_brief_reflection` is `_otr_story_brief.py:446`;
   `_build_left` is `video_engine.py:1442`; the treatment line renders as
   padded `Style    :` at `video_engine.py:1762` (an earlier "no longer greps"
   note here was a driver grep miss, corrected by the r2 panel -- BOTH
   consumers are live and both move in the repoint). Sharper finding on
   item 4: `ending_template` is NOT "computed and never read" -- the catalog
   computes it (`_otr_style_catalog.py:906`) AND the composer reads it
   (`_otr_line_composer.py:809-810`); what is missing is the THREAD between
   them -- no call site passes it into a LineRequest. That is a DECISION GATE
   inside the campaign, not a confirmed build step: wire the thread or rip the
   dead ends, decided with the panel at build. Same for the ghost-name fork:
   **default = scrub briefs after cast lock** (conservative -- no unlocked name
   reaches the listener); the operator may overrule to propagate pitch names.
   `style_seed_env` confirmed validator-only (`capability_profiles.py:116`).
   Item 5 (the 120-key `meta` rip) stays a gated block of its own, NOT part of
   this campaign.
2. **The P0 repair rung tells the truth (2 items, ~0.5 day).**
   `repair_literal_source_metadata` (`_otr_scifi_source_repair.py`, called from
   `_otr_scifi_codex.py`): (a) emit a receipt per pruned span/evidence-row/fact
   -- silent pruning violates the plan's own Invariant 3; (b) give the repairer
   the `allowed_source_fields` allowlist or prune per row, so one bad rehome
   stops poisoning the whole artifact. Suite-provable with fixtures. The HTML
   block-join separator stays an OPERATOR decision (coordinate-system change)
   and is NOT part of this chunk.
3. **Script-parse repair: fix the SPEC, then code it (~0.5 day docs + panel,
   then 1-2 days code).** The claim that increments 1-5 are code-ready is
   STALE: `docs/2026-08-03-script-parse-repair-CODE-READY.md` itself says r3
   returned seven must-fixes that invalidate the call/trace design and
   everything after its STATUS block is a draft. The next chunk is the spec
   correction folding those seven in (a kibitz arc IS the vehicle); only then do
   increments 1-5 become codeable.
4. **Passage-lane craft scoring + the stichomythia floor (~1 day).**
   `_otr_passage_selector.py` has no scoring functions -- the Fable craft
   criteria (French-scene boundaries, entrance/exit starts, couplet ends,
   continuation-word penalties) are all unbuilt. Score, keep top-K, seeded hash
   within the class. Same chunk: the per-beat word floor excludes stichomythia,
   so a merge rule or floor exemption in `_otr_episode_budget`. Pure Python +
   tests. **Sequencing (r1): runs AFTER the ON DECK sprint lands and re-grounds
   against whatever item 1 changed** -- both touch the fidelity selection
   surfaces.
5. **Cast-list parser: the two weak plays (~0.5 day).** Midsummer 1/12 and
   Comedy of Errors 1/7 gendered -- mechanicals/servants in shapes
   `_otr_character_roster.py` does not read yet. Vendored texts are on disk;
   offline; suite-provable against the sidecars.
6. **Small-items batch (~0.5 day, ONE campaign over the batch, one commit each):**
   * `OTRImageGenDispatcher` (`otr_image_gen_dispatcher.py:1412`) has no
     `IS_CHANGED` while depending on external file existence -- confirmed by
     grep, none in the file. Decide the CONTRACT before coding (r2): either
     fingerprint EVERY actual external dependency or deliberately force
     re-runs for this side-effectful node -- a partial path fingerprint still
     serves stale results.
   * Rotated server logs have no retention policy.
   * The `provider_side` three-part-rule regression (picked AND forced
     `cloud_kling_avatar`).
   * The shared `row_is_active(...)` evaluator over captured state -- confirmed
     absent from the tree -- closing the four env-read sites named in OPEN BUGS.

## PARKED -- D2 (resume when the operator wants renders again)

Reset per AGENTS.md section 4, boot headless, run **320-word `public_domain` or
`shakespeare` still legs until one fails** (~1 in 6). Three legs on 08-04 all
published, which at that rate is a ~58% chance of zero -- neither confirmed nor
cleared.

**Either outcome is valid.** A publish is a clean leg; a **fail-closed with
complete evidence is the PROOF D1 WORKS** and is the outcome you want. When it
fails the server log names the branch itself -- arm, token, index, canonical
`prompt_hash`, repr-escaped excerpt -- plus a compact JSON `MISSING_TARGET`
record emitted BEFORE the raise (the canonical runner truncates the exception at
500 chars, `scripts/otr_api.py:749`). The log survives reboot;
`scripts/_otr_rotate_log.ps1` rotates instead of truncating. D3 then fixes THAT
branch at its root and `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` gets a mechanism, not a guess.

**Do NOT:** weaken the completion gate, revive the portrait-init fallback, or
rebuild the withdrawn "give the collapse guard a still owner" fix -- the 08-04
postmortem disproved that chain (70 whiffs and 69 cast-time deferrals across 11
passes that ALL published).

Record: `docs/2026-08-04-POSTMORTEM-still-unmaterialized-320w.md`,
`docs/2026-08-04-D1-SHIPPED-still-skip-evidence.md`.

## AFTER THIS SPRINT -- the standing block order

One coder window at a time; every chunk = focused tests + full suite + Bug Bible
+ commit AND push + `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.

```text
  -> WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract  (CODE-COMPLETE; blocked on ONE operator
                                         decision -- see OPEN BUGS)
  -> [r3+r4] Randomizer A
  -> [r3+r4] dynamic_story           (wiring only -- rev-5 DESIGN stays FINAL)
  -> re-observe the PARKED story bugs on the next real render legs;
     batch-triage whatever is left
  -> THEN, and only then, ROADMAP.md -- OFF THIS PLAN
       (its order after the SFX park: product expansion -> LEAN-MEAN ->
        RunPod -> release)
```

**LEAN-MEAN IS NOT IN THIS QUEUE and must not be re-added.** Operator direction
2026-07-29 moved FRONT and TAIL both to the Lean-mean campaign section of
`ROADMAP.md`, with their chunk chains, the W2 migration-first mandate, the
ENGINE_MATRIX W6 sub-step and the full `r2 -> r3 -> r4` pin carried over intact.
It runs after the randomizer and `dynamic_story` (the SFX step that used to sit
between them is PARKED). A window that wants to rip dead code is on the wrong
document.

**Block detail:**

1. **Randomizer Rolls Design A** -- `docs/2026-07-12-randomizer-rolls-r2-coding-plan.md`.
   NOT gated any more: extensibility landed and absorbed its `_otr_lane_specs`
   authority, so this shrinks to `_otr_bank_roll` + eligibility. Its r3 brief must
   carry two deltas -- the absorbed authority, and that the bank list is a LIVE
   registry read (`list_bank_ids()` can return a CLIENT bank; eligibility must
   treat one as an ordinary peer) rather than a six-row literal. 1-2 d + 1 GPU day.
2. **`dynamic_story` visual direction** -- rev-5 FINAL; roster-agnostic; re-derive
   IDs at build. After the randomizer. The "do not rerun the design panels" rule
   and the r3+r4 requirement are NOT in conflict: the rule protects the DESIGN,
   r3 asks whether that design still wires to the code that exists today, and the
   roster, the routing authority and the writer tail have all moved since rev-5.
   5-9 coder-days + 2-4 GPU days.
3. **SFX campaign -- PARKED (operator doubt, 2026-08-04).** The operator doubts
   it will work well with the video model and calls it a much bigger lift than
   imagined -- and ROADMAP's own estimate agrees on the lift: 8-15 coder-days +
   2-4 elapsed live days, the largest single item on the runway. Parked, not
   killed: the Timeline Cue Ledger and generated-SFX designs stay in
   `ROADMAP.md` as evidence, and NOTHING spends against them -- no R4.1 refit,
   no C0/C1, no SFX coding -- until an explicit operator revival. If revived,
   the R4.1 refit is still the re-ground; no second SFX queue, no library
   fallback.

Open judgment question (render-window, not a coder slot): the LOCAL mistral/gemma
writer matrix. The Sonnet arm of the creative-writer question is answered
(`docs/2026-07-17-model-bakeoff-scoreboard.md`); the local roster comparison
never ran.

### STANDING RE-GROUND GATE -- r3/r4 before ANY block above (operator 2026-07-24)

Every remaining block was planned against a tree that no longer exists. Since
those docs were written the LLM vetoes were ripped, THE LAW landed, six banks were
renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings were retired, the whole extensibility
build shipped, and the suite grew past 8,000. Line cites, seam names and file
inventories are the first things to rot, and every one of these blocks is a rip or
a rewire that acts on exactly those.

- **Default entry point is `r3` (wiring).** These plans already have an r1 and an
  r2 on record, so the cheap re-ground is wiring against CURRENT code, then `r4`.
- **Drop to `r2` when r3 finds the CODING PLAN wrong**, not just the line numbers.
  Stale cites are an r3 fix. A seam that no longer exists, an authority that moved,
  a precondition another build already satisfied or destroyed -- that invalidates
  the coding plan itself, and patching an r2 from inside an r3 produces a plan
  nobody reviewed.
- **If in doubt, start at r2.** A wasted r2 costs one panel round; executing a
  stale coding plan costs a day of rips against the wrong file list.
- **No block executes without an r4 convergence at current HEAD.** Record the run
  under `kibitz-runs/<date>-<block>-r<N>/` and cite it in the block entry.

## SCOPE FOR v2.0 (operator -- read before picking up fidelity work)

**Two banks, not three.** `shakespeare` is VERBATIM and gets the executor.
`public_domain` stays PROSE and is explicitly allowed to be FUZZY -- operator: "the
LLM's job to try to do book prose but not perfect", and "I'm fine if it can pick up
real dialogue great, if not that's OK". Best-effort, never verbatim, never gated.

**But fuzzy WORDING is not the same as melding two stories, and that distinction is
the actual requirement.** Operator: "public domain does need to be updated so it
doesn't try to meld two different radio drama things and tries to keep true to the
source." That names the delivered defect exactly -- an H.G. Wells chapter performed
as taking place in "Arkham, Massachusetts", Lovecraft's fictional town, with the
time machine shrunk to a pocket watch. Two authors fused into one episode. The
contract for this bank:

* FREE with the wording. Invent the speech; carry the source's own quoted lines
  where they exist (the Wells chapter has real ones -- "Story!" cried the Editor).
* NOT free with the WORLD. Its place, people, period and events are the source's.
  No relocating, no importing a second work's setting or characters, no genre
  transposition.

Two changes serve that, and neither is a gate:
1. **PROMPT-ONLY** -- the pack asks for the source's world and its own quoted
   speech, and forbids importing anything the source does not contain.
2. **Stop the content-blind rolls contaminating it.** A catalog sound world ("a
   fire in the grate, a mantel clock, a teacup") was imposed on Wells' Richmond
   parlour, and `arc_shape` stamped "heist" on a man demonstrating a time machine.
   Foreign frames arriving from a dice roll are melding by another route.

**`public_domain_plays` is DEFERRED TO v2.1**
(`docs/2026-08-03-public-domain-plays-PLAN.md`, research complete, nothing built).
That avoids a third bank row, which is never one line: it would force a pack
directory, a registered fetcher, an executable pipeline, family-policy coverage and
updates to exact-roster contract tests.

**Two hard operator rules that override the repo's written ethos here:**
* **The word count is a REQUEST, not a gate.** No refusals, no hard gates, no
  shunts. Shipped: `select_passage` returns its closest performable passage rather
  than raising (`a4bc7917`).
* **No "dread py assertion workflow killers."** A render must not die. The
  reconciliation: fail loud in AUTHORING-TIME TOOLS (the fetcher, manifest
  validation -- things a human runs and reads), but in the RENDER PATH degrade to
  the best available result and write an honest machine-readable receipt into the
  ledger saying what degraded and why. The ledger tells the truth; the episode
  still ships. No hazard / under-construction flags -- `runnable` was checked and is
  NOT one; all six real banks are runnable and its only job is making the
  "+ Add Your Own" signpost fail loud on selection.

**An extra LLM VERIFIER pass is sanctioned** ("is this accurate to the story, are
these characters really in the scene?") -- but as a RE-SELECT, never an abort: if it
rejects a window, take the next-best candidate, bounded, then ship the best one with
a receipt. **Deferred until specced (r1):** it currently has no stated input, output
or artifact position. If built, it reviews the FINAL accepted script, stays
advisory/non-terminal under THE LAW, and records evidence-backed findings; until
that spec exists, do not quietly add another model pass.

**Casting must be smart about voices and gender.** The dramatis personae section is
the ROSTER and its descriptions carry gender; it is parsed at VENDOR time into the
provenance sidecar so the render path never infers (`d8752d69`). A manifest-approved
roster also replaces the refuted "speaker appears twice" heading rule -- that rule
would have deleted BEATRICE's single speech from `much_ado__act3_scene1`, the scene
named for her, where that one speech IS the payoff.

**Still open on casting:**
* **Midsummer 1/12 and Comedy of Errors 1/7 gendered** -- mechanicals and servants
  in cast-list shapes not yet read, recorded `unknown` rather than guessed. Operator
  is open to a vendor-time LLM/web lookup as the final tier for stragglers, under
  its own `gender_source` so it stays auditable. (Corpus elsewhere: AYL 6/6, Lear
  9/9, R&J 3/3, Much Ado 4/4, Tempest 3/3, Twelfth Night 5/6, Macbeth 7/8.)
* **Voice-pool capacity may belong in window ELIGIBILITY, not just casting.** The
  Bark pool is 6 male / 4 female against a 6-character ceiling, and Macbeth 1.3
  needs five distinct voices.
* **Disguise ruling (settled):** ROSALIND-as-Ganymede and VIOLA-as-Cesario keep
  FEMALE voices -- the source prefix says who speaks and the irony depends on the
  audience hearing her; the announcer states the disguise from a manifest field.

**Visual style: randomized is fine** (operator). The earlier objection to
`archival_documentary` over a Folger comedy was about TRUTHFULNESS, not variety --
the credits claimed a story scaffold the episode did not have. With the words
genuinely the play's own and the strip naming the real source, a randomly drawn look
is artistic range. (`visual_style_policy` was RIPPED on 2026-08-04 accordingly.)

## THE PASSAGE LANE (operator ruling; built, with craft criteria still unbuilt)

> "For shakespeare I'm open to a version that is very strict and finds, based on
> word count and random choice, hones in on a specific part of a play to get real
> specific dialogue, no paraphrasing."

A play episode is a contiguous WINDOW of consecutive speeches, carried verbatim,
chosen to fit the word budget, the cast ceiling and the beat topology. Built as
`nodes/_otr_passage_selector.py` (`a82460ec`), 24 tests, proven on all 14 vendored
scenes: every selected line is verbatim from its source file.

**The number that governs everything:** a passage is performed against VOICED
BEATS, and beats step with the ACT TOPOLOGY, not the word count --
`voiced_beat_count()` in `_otr_episode_budget` is the one owner. 30-120 target words
buy THREE beats, 150-200 six, 300-1200 fourteen. At 120 words a passage is a
two-or-three speech fragment; at 300 it is an eleven-to-thirteen speech exchange.
**The fidelity floor should be 300, not the operator's initial 120** -- three beats
cannot hold a change of mind, and every manifest already recommends 300. A long
speech spans consecutive beats in the same voice (`ceil(words/80)`,
`BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX`); without that the lane silently loses Lear's love test,
Prospero's history and Juliet's balcony speeches.

**Craft criteria for selection, from the Fable review -- NOT yet implemented:** keep
windows inside one French scene (never cross an `[Enter ...]` that adds a speaker);
prefer starts on an entrance or a question, penalise openings on continuation words
(And/But/Nay/'Tis) and speeches under 4 words (Folger prints shared verse lines
separately, so those start mid-breath); prefer ends on an exit, a scene end or a
rhymed couplet, avoid ending on a question or a trailing dash. Score, keep the top
K, then apply the seeded hash within that class. Showcase example: Romeo and Juliet
2.2 lines 257-318, `[Enter Juliet above again.]` "Hist, Romeo, hist!" through
"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes... [He exits.]" -- 14 speeches, ~250 words, entrance
start, couplet-and-exit end, a complete arc that maps 1:1 onto the 14-beat topology.

**Prose is a different lane and the review was blunt about it.** Wells' chapter is
~70% narration; a characters-only performance discards the book's actual asset. The
faithful prose lane should be a NARRATOR/READER role speaking the author's own
sentences, abridged by CUTTING ONLY with every dropped span logged in provenance --
"abridged verbatim", which is also the period-correct radio form. Defer the
paraphrased variant until a dialogue-poor source genuinely needs it: as specced it is
indistinguishable to a listener from the existing original lane with borrowed names,
and it reopens the failure class just closed. If built, the announcer must say
"freely adapted from".

**Also flagged, unfixed:** the per-beat word FLOOR (20 at three acts) excludes
stichomythia -- "Nothing, my lord." / "Nothing?" / "Nothing." cannot be three beats --
so rapid exchanges need a merge rule or a floor exemption; `[aside]` and `[within]`
are machine-readable delivery hints worth carrying into per-beat metadata; and the
Wells manifest synopsis says the traveller "returns with a strange machine" when in
the real chapter he returns limping and the machine never appears.

## THE ADAPTATION DESIGN (hardened, NOT yet built)

Plan of record: `kibitz-runs/2026-08-03-adaptation-fidelity/r2/final.md`.

**The keystone correction: compile source speech, do not generate it.** A ledger row
that merely POINTS at a source segment proves structure, not meaning --
`PRODUCTION_SPRINT_LESSONS.md` lesson 11 documents that exact failure class.
Source-owned text must be materialized deterministically from an authenticated
segmented artifact and verified against it. "Summarize into X words" then means
SELECTING WHICH REAL SEGMENTS FIT THE BUDGET, not paraphrasing -- which also removes
the VRAM hazard, since no model sits in the source-speech path.

Settled by arithmetic: an episode cannot exceed **1,520 words** (19 voiced beats at
act_count 7, `BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX` 80), so full-scene performance is impossible
without redesigning beat topology. Build target is the 300-word unit.

**NEXT, IN ORDER:**

1. **The segmented source artifact** (schema, spans, hashes,
   `body[start:end] == segment.text`, omission receipts) and the pass-to-field
   ownership table -- **nothing else codes until that table exists.**
2. **Cast from the selected cut.** Real scenes carry 3-12 speakers against a
   6-character ceiling (`_otr_casting.py` 1-6, `OutlineRequest` rejects >6), so which
   speakers appear must follow from the cut that fits the word budget. Coupled hard
   to the capacity guard: at act_count 1 there are exactly THREE voiced beats, so a
   4-person cast is a mathematically guaranteed `CastVoiceCoverageError` -- the
   failure that killed `scifi_news` in the six-bank run. `compute_episode_budget`
   must also receive the TRUE locked cast.
3. **Loosen the count-match invariant** (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4061-4067` hard-
   raises on any locked != requested) and change the pack text that tells the model
   to drop figures.
4. **Extend `_otr_provenance.py`** -- do not add a second attribution owner -- and
   bind its output to the verified body hash.
5. **Schema migration** to retire `cast_hints`; still required by the validators and
   by `public_domain_manifest_schema.json`, so manifests and tests migrate in the
   same change. (`visual_style_policy`, the other half of this item, was ripped
   2026-08-04.)

**KNOWN AND NOT FIXED:** `canonicalize_shakespeare_text` truncates at 12,000 chars
and the interpreter sees only the first 5,000, so a 3,445-word scene reaches the
brief as ~880 words, silently. Belongs with the artifact work, where each beat is
fed its own segment rather than a blind prefix.

## STYLE / IDENTITY DECISION WORK (one campaign, next CODER window)

Grounded by the 2026-08-03 four-agent forensics; every line has a file:line in the
session traces.

1. **"Invent one and tag it"**: add a derived style/genre field to
   `run_story_brief_reflection` (`_otr_story_brief.py:446` -- proven content-loyal on
   both specimens), stamp beside `story_brief`, repoint the treatment `Style:` line
   (`video_engine.py:1762`) and the HUD (`video_engine.py:1336` -> `_build_left`
   `:1466`) at it. Highest-leverage item here: it fixes the credits line for all six
   banks uniformly.
2. **Rename `meta.style` -> `meta.story_scaffold`** (operator: too many metas; the
   field is neither scifi nor a description). Consumers move in ONE atomic change:
   writer stamps, credits `_story_style_receipt`, `visual_plan.style`,
   `video_engine.py:1336`, tests -- AND the ledger validators (r3):
   `_otr_ledger_consistency.py` pins the field in its matrix
   (`MatrixRow("style", ...)` at `:68`, `:177`) and `_otr_ledger_cleanup.py`
   reads it too; missing them fails ledger validation on the first episode.
3. **Ghost-name reconciliation fork**: pitch cast never reaches `lock_cast` (names
   are a pure pool draw; `source_character_names` deliberately None for invention
   lanes). Decide: scrub briefs after cast lock, or propagate pitch names. Evidence:
   Evelyn/Leonard as offscreen lore; Fogbound Rails bio still opens "Lizzie Gray".
4. **Dead fields found**: `ending_template` computed but zero LineRequest call sites
   pass it; `seed_policy.style_seed_env` validated but unconsumed; `dramatic_state`
   derived PRE-dialogue goes stale in the treatment.
5. **`meta` is a 120-key drawer** -- the cleanup the operator keeps asking for. Scope
   as its own rip with the ledger law (every field one owner).

## OPEN OPERATOR QUESTIONS (flagged, awaiting a ruling)

* **Does `media_archive` want the catalog premise at all**, or the same
  scaffold-off treatment as `original`? Found by the five-bank beat test: a
  `pirate_radio_resistance_drama` premise was drawn over a film-reel standoff
  seeded by a real Library of Congress item on 'Midnight' (1939) -- the operator
  caught it on screen. Second specimen of the content-blind-draw class. The
  scaffold-off rule so far was stated only for `original`.
* **Rename the un-namespaced `OTR_WAN_*` knobs?** `eng_wan_i2v`'s six frozen knobs
  are `OTR_WAN_STEPS` / `_CFG` / `_SHIFT` / `_SAMPLER` / `_SCHEDULER` / `_NEGATIVE`
  -- no `I2V` namespace, unlike every sibling. Default if unruled: leave them. The
  freeze already removed the power that made the missing namespace dangerous (they
  are consent-act-only now and cannot bind a production leg), and a rename would
  silently break operator muscle memory for a sweep.
* **`style_tail_policy`'s closed enum cannot express a SHIPPED path.**
  `VALID_STYLE_TAIL_POLICIES` has `full` and `minimal_clean`, but
  `build_radio_host_prompt`'s `ltx_radio_mouth` branch
  (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:394-401`) RETURNS EARLY with
  `"%s, warm dramatic lighting"`, skipping both `finish_visual_prompt(...,
  era_profile="still")` and the `image_grade_tail` append -- deliberately, per the
  2026-07-02 operator look direction. The `ltx_audio_in` bookend row nonetheless
  declares `style_tail_policy="full"`. Adding an enum token is an operator call:
  either add a third token for "canonical warm, no era tail, no grade tail", or
  ratify that the `ltx_radio_face` path is EXEMPT from the plan's style-tail
  authority. Default if unruled: the exemption, because it changes no behaviour.
* **After profile retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The full
  statement of this one is in the WAN 8-GB row under OPEN BUGS -- it is the single
  blocker on a code-complete block.
* **`check_compatibility`: ratify the inert constant, or schedule the rip?** See
  Open risks.

## OPEN BUGS / DEFECTS (live, not yet closed)

MECHANICAL defects survive story-engine churn; STORY-QUALITY judgments do not. That
split is why the two eyeball-era entries at the end are PARKED rather than live.

**EVERY LINE CITE IN THIS SECTION IS SUSPECT.** Each one checked during the
2026-07-27 triage had moved: `_is_cloud_video_engine` is `render_driver.py:1599` not
`1274-1295`; the "NO FALLBACK to text-only" refusal is `:2148` not `1801-1817`;
`_use_i2v` is `eng_ltx_video.py:583` not `559-572`. The defects are mostly still
real; their coordinates are not. **Re-pin a row's cite when you touch it.**
Path note (verified 2026-08-04): engine adapters live under
`nodes/_otr_video_engines/` (and `_otr_audio_engines/`, `_otr_image_engines/`)
-- bare `eng_*.py` cites in these rows are shorthand for those paths.

### The P0 / source-span cluster (2026-07-30)

- **`full_text` reaches the span coordinate system carrying HTML BLOCK JOINS WITH
  NO SEPARATOR, and on the live evidence this is the DOMINANT P0 failure cause.**
  Measured in the campaign logs: `'...Field of Martian PolygonsNASA/JPL-'`,
  `'...and the School ofEngine'`, `'...what you're doing.Let's s'`, `'...(AMR).The
  resea'`. The RSS adapter strips tags without inserting whitespace, so two elements
  fuse into one token. `_normalize_span_source_text` collapses whitespace RUNS but
  cannot insert a space that was never there, so the model quotes the sentences a
  reader sees and they are not byte-exact in the stored text -- exactly the
  "non-literal source span" rejection that killed 12 of the 15 P0 legs.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed by A-3:** inserting separators is a WIDER change to the
  coordinate system `source_digest` pins -- an operator decision, and it belongs in
  the source adapter rather than the codex normalizer. Owed: which adapter builds
  `full_text`, whether a separator can be inserted at admission without breaking any
  accepted ledger, and a fixture from these four strings.
- **The deterministic P0 rung PRUNES SILENTLY, which violates the plan's own
  Invariant 3.** `repair_literal_source_metadata` drops an unsupported span, then its
  evidence row, then the fact -- and emits no receipt. An accepted P0 index simply
  has fewer facts than the model wrote, and nothing says which were dropped or why.
  Under "fail loud, not fatal" the degrade is the right direction and the silence is
  not.
- **The deterministic P0 rung is ALL-OR-NOTHING across an artifact, and can poison
  its own good work.** It is handed `a0_payload` (all seven keys) while
  `_validate_fact_index` restricts spans to `allowed_source_fields` (the projection).
  A quote rehomed into a field the projection omitted makes `post_validator` reject
  the WHOLE repaired artifact -- "cites source field ... outside the supplied P0
  evidence" -- so one unlucky rehome discards every correct prune in the same pass.
  Either give the repairer the allowlist or prune per row.
- **Nothing measures whether a pruned P0 index is ACCEPTED** (recorded, no action
  owed yet). No live leg has ever run with the deterministic rung reachable (it became
  reachable at `47c554fa`, after the campaign stopped), and the rejection logs carry
  only a truncated `raw head` plus no source payload, so the question cannot be
  answered offline. A-1's instrumentation is what makes the next campaign able to
  answer it.
- **`scifi_news` P0 convergence defect** -- both 120w and 320w legs fail in P0 after
  two attempts on non-literal fact source spans; provider/model convergence, extends
  BUG-11.35. NOT a word/length gate. Blocks the last 120w receipt and the
  `scifi_news` live reverify (PBUGs 20260712-22/23/24/25, fixed in tree, reverify
  still owed).
- **`scifi_news_pro` provider capacity** -- `requested_output=2800` vs provider cap
  `512`; the whole-artifact retry contracts LANDED @ `314dd481` are the base; the
  residual fix is now unblocked. Related independent items: the P9 8K
  structured-capacity follow-up + the GGUF structured-enforcement NEWBUG. Do not
  raise the minimum word target as a capacity workaround.

### The 8 GB / profile cluster

- **WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract -- CODE-COMPLETE and PROOF-INCOMPLETE. It is
  not a coding item; the one thing blocking it is an OPERATOR DECISION.**

  **Already BUILT and WIRED end to end** (verified hop by hop): `otr_8gb_wan.json`
  `video.max_render_frames=17` -> `capability_profiles` optional-key validator ->
  `_otr_workflow_apply.py:532` flatten -> `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_wan.json`
  node-87 widget slot 14 = 17 -> `otr_video_director.py:423` policy stamp ->
  `otr_shot_lock.py:1722` `ledger.video.max_render_frames` ->
  `render_driver.py:3328` per-adapter policy -> `motion_common.profile_max_render_frames()`
  -> `eng_wan_ti2v._floor_length` hard cap (`:730`) and `_planned_length` refusal
  (`:785`), with `render_driver.py:3845` refusing on drift. Landed `f914f0a4`, dead
  node-87 widget repaired `7f4644a1` + `8f41af27`, WAN deliberately excluded from
  `frame_contract.PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` by `b23fc035`, recipe frozen `71753cb4` /
  `8424f369`, whole-beat single-UNET-load `439ce8c7`. Regression net:
  `tests/test_remaining_video_contracts.py:16-194` (nine hop-by-hop tests) plus
  `tests/test_multiclip_effective_contract.py:216,234`.

  **THE ONE OPERATOR DECISION (the actual blocker).** The ceiling reaches a leg ONLY
  through a variant workflow or a hand-set widget: `otr_canonical.json` node 87 ships
  `max_render_frames=0`, so a plain canonical WAN run is UNPINNED and inherits
  `_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES = 177` -- exactly the 2026-07-23 failure shape. The obvious patch
  (pin 17 in the canonical) is WRONG: the canonical serves every tier, and 17 is the
  8-GB tier's number, so pinning it would cap LTX/HuMo 16-GB legs too. The channel
  that carries 17 today is `config/profiles/*.json`, which is on the RETIREMENT list
  -- so writing new behaviour onto it is forbidden. **Decision needed: after profile
  retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The shape that fits the
  per-adapter-ownership doctrine is that `eng_wan_ti2v` DECLARES its own tier ceiling
  (a capability-row field), the widget becomes an operator OVERRIDE with 0 meaning
  "use the adapter's own contract", and the profile channel stops mattering. That is
  a real design change with a live-behaviour blast radius on any card with headroom
  (the VRAM predictor currently gets to ask for more than 17 and often can), so it is
  NOT being written on assumption. Ratify the shape first.

  **Also open, all PROOF obligations rather than build work:** the 18-engine GPU
  campaign is engine COVERAGE, not an 8-GB qualification; and a render on a PHYSICAL
  8 GB card is still owed -- the four-arm bench PREQUALIFIED on a 16 GB card told to
  reserve 8 GiB, which is not the same claim.

  **One untested edge, cheap to close whenever this reopens:** WAN is out of
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`, so a tier ceiling and a multi-clip plan CAN contradict by
  design, and `_planned_length` hard-refuses mid-episode when they do -- but no test
  asserts a 17-frame tier survives a multi-segment beat. `:216`/`:234` in
  `test_multiclip_effective_contract.py` pin the topology, not that outcome.

- **THE 8 GB PROFILE FAMILY CANNOT RUN ITS OWN WRITER** (found 2026-07-27;
  LIVE-REPRODUCED TWICE on two different banks, then confirmed by a two-strikes
  kibitz panel -- codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high and agy independently reached the same
  diagnosis). `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` pairs a 12B GGUF writer
  (`gemma-4-12b-it-Q4_K_M`, 6.63 GB of weights) with `llm.gguf_n_ctx: 2048` under a
  declared `vram_ceiling_gb: 6.8`. The pipeline's own smallest prompt needs **2064
  input tokens** and P0 reserves 2800 output (`_P0_BASE_OUTPUT_TOKENS`), so the leg
  dies in `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter` before any render. Live preflight, verbatim:
  `Needed=8.13 GB (weights=6.63, kv=1.40 @ n_ctx=2048)`. **ctx is the SYMPTOM; the
  writer MODEL is the cause** -- 4096 puts it near 9.4-9.5 GB, OOM on the very card
  the tier exists for. Every 2048-ctx profile (`otr_8gb_ltx`, `otr_8gb_wan`,
  `8gb_lite`, `cpu_floor`, `otr_amd8_rocm`, `otr_cloud_lanes`) is `status=draft` and
  every one pairs 2048 with the 12B; the only `status=shipping` profile is
  `16gb_full` (4096 + Mistral-Nemo). **NOT a one-line profile edit:** the GGUF
  registry ships exactly two rows (`unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF`,
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`); `google/gemma-2-2b-it` is in the TRANSFORMERS catalog, a
  different lane -- agy proposed it and was wrong, recorded so nobody re-derives it.
  **Largely mooted by profile retirement:** with no profile passed, the canonical
  JSON's own `gguf_n_ctx=4096` / Q8_0 binds and the leg runs. **Fix the profiles or
  finish retiring them; do not leave both.**

- **A2 -- HELD pending the profile retire-now vs retire-later scope. The profile's
  `llm` section silently overrides the canonical JSON, and the applied-overrides echo
  HIDES it.** Held because its entire subject is `apply_profile_to_workflow` and the
  printed echo -- a channel directed to be retired, so building on it now may be work
  on something scheduled for deletion. The fix SHAPE is correct and ready when the
  scope is settled. The profile's `llm.*` values win over the widgets the operator set
  in `otr_canonical.json` (which ships `creative`/`technical` = `google/gemma-4-12b-it`,
  `gguf_n_ctx=4096`, `gguf_quant=Q8_0`, `llm_vram_ceiling_gb=14.5`), while
  `scripts/otr_api.py:817` flattens only `role_overrides` / `slot_overrides` /
  `features` + two `seed_policy` keys for the printed summary -- so the run reports
  "16 overrides" while ALSO having replaced the entire LLM configuration. **Causal
  chain corrected** (triage 2026-07-27, codex; grounded): the override does NOT come
  from the validator's `OTR_ACTIVE_PROFILE` export -- it happens at submission,
  `scripts/otr_canonical_api_run.py:157` -> `apply_profile_to_workflow`; and the real
  applier (`nodes/_otr_workflow_apply.py:492-540`) ALREADY flattens `llm`; only the
  printed echo is stale. **Fix: generate the echo FROM the applier's flattened map.**
  Adding `llm` to the echo by hand leaves the next drift intact.

- **The `ltx_8gb` render-length ceiling has TWO owners that only agree by
  coincidence** (found 2026-07-27, B6 panel, two lenses independently). The coverage
  PLANNER reads `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` `video.max_render_frames`, and
  `ltx_8gb` is the sole member of `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`. The ADAPTER's own
  pre-render refusal reads `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES`. Today both land on 161 (profile
  unpinned, env unset), so nothing breaks. But `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_ltx.env.json`
  ships `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES=97` and NOTHING currently reads that file. The day a
  launcher honours it without also pinning the profile, the planner emits a 98-161
  frame segment and the adapter refuses it MID-EPISODE -- after the stills are minted
  and, on a multi-segment beat, after the 6.34 GiB checkpoint is hoisted.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed in B6:** pinning the profile to 97 changes how a 237-frame
  beat partitions, which is a production planning decision, not a cleanup. The preset
  carries a `_ceiling_note` saying do not export it alone. Compare WAN, which B3
  wired correctly: `otr_8gb_wan.json` sets BOTH `launch.env.OTR_WAN_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES`
  and `video.max_render_frames`.

### Coverage, canvas and clip-contract

- **The route lock is ONE NODE TOO LATE for the image phase** (found 2026-07-25, node
  order confirmed against the canonical JSON: `87 VideoDirector -> 88 ImageDirector ->
  89 MetaBrief -> 90 ShotLock -> 91 ImageGenDispatcher -> 92 VideoRenderBatch`).
  `resolve_final_shot_engines` runs at node 92, but stills are minted at 91 and image
  PROMPTS at 89. The landed fix closed the spine-validation gap; the image phase still
  relies on its own MIRROR (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt._effective_prompt_engine_for_role`,
  whose docstring says it "mirrors the image dispatcher's effective-engine seam").
  **Chunk 1 of the coverage block is the fix.** Note node 89 precedes node 90, so
  hoisting to ShotLock still does not put MetaBrief downstream of the authority --
  that needs a VideoDirector-time freeze and is NOT in scope. (This is also the
  "image-phase still ownership" item from the campaign queue.)
- **THREE silent coverage mechanisms exist, not one** (found 2026-07-25).
  Mechanism 1, the engine mirror/ping-pong (`wrapper_bridge.extend_frames_to_target`),
  is GONE from `eng_ltx_8gb` -- pinned behaviourally by a test that detonates the
  helper and renders successfully. It REMAINS in `eng_wan_ti2v`, deliberately and
  permanently: WAN renders a short native clip on purpose and fills the beat with it,
  which is the shipped 8GB tier contract `PBUG-20260723-02` protects. **Still open:**
  composite loop-fill (`otr_silent_composite._should_loop_fill`, which also SUPPRESSES
  its own underrun warning once it activates) and held-last-frame. For `ltx_8gb` the
  composite path is now de facto unreachable -- the adapter returns exactly the
  requested count or raises -- but not structurally impossible:
  `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` reports the size of the array it piped into ffmpeg
  rather than re-probing what ffmpeg wrote, so an encode-side drop could still
  under-report. PRE-EXISTING; close it when the assembly boundary is next opened.
- **`_should_loop_fill` names the permanent fix and it is now being built**
  (`otr_silent_composite.py:244-266`): *"The real fix is phrase-chunking (render the
  beat's correct duration so it never underruns) -- tracked as a follow-up."* The
  coverage block IS that follow-up.
- **THE 7d-PREFLIGHT THAT "PROVED THE GPU" RAN AT THE WRONG CANVAS** (found
  2026-07-27, B5 panel; verified -- and it corrects a claim this file once made).
  `render_single` and both HTTP entry points use the older ledger-free `build_request`,
  which never reaches the canvas seam and defaults to `OTR_VIDEO_RENDER_CANVAS`
  (832x480). So the "GPU IS PROVEN" leg (`ltx_8gb`, 25 frames, 3004 MB) exercised
  832x480, not the production canvas. `render_single` parity is explicitly deferred by
  the O1 judgment; what must NOT happen is another "proof" through that harness being
  read as a production proof. (The 512x288 canvas itself HAS since rendered live --
  bench arm D, three cells -- but through a DIRECT-NODE graph, which proves the canvas
  and the recipe, not the seam.)
- **The ShotLock WRITE-side canvas validation is still owed** (O1 judgment item 1).
  `otr_shot_lock.py` stamps `video.canonical_canvas` unvalidated from a possibly-empty
  policy. B5 made this non-load-bearing for the render (the engine declares its own
  canvas now), so it is no longer urgent -- the drift guard in
  `tests/test_ltx_8gb_canonical_canvas.py` covers the disagreement that matters. Close
  it when the general canvas resolver lands.
- **Odd-canvas evenness is validated at the ENCODER, not where the canvas is chosen.**
  The stride defect itself is closed (`b1f2ee86`): `ffmpeg_silent_mp4_cmd` declares the
  REAL width/height and `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` REFUSES an odd canvas by name,
  because yuv420p subsamples chroma 2x2 and cannot represent an odd dimension. Still
  true and NOT fixed: neither `WanInitImageMixin._dims()` nor the `Canvas` schema
  validates evenness, so an odd canvas is caught late rather than at the choice. No
  live producer builds one today (832x480, 512x288, 1472x832 are all even).
- **`CanonicalClip.frame_count` -- "the integer timing authority" -- HALF CLOSED**
  (`58e288af` + `40780b82`, count closed @ `48e3c6fb` without paying a decode). Every
  module that writes a clip now ffprobes it, and a roster gate in
  `tests/test_terminal_frame.py` fails by name for any module that writes a clip
  without proving it. What this proves and what it does not: it proves the muxer wrote
  what it was piped, which is the right question for a clip written by ONE ffmpeg
  pass; it does NOT prove decodability, which is why `assemble_beat_segments` still
  decode-counts every ASSEMBLED beat and must keep doing so. **Re-verify before
  acting:** this row's "still self-declared elsewhere" pointers (the four `viz_*` and
  four `still_*` engines) were both closed afterwards, so the remaining open surface
  may be empty.
- **KNOWN LIMIT of the widened roster gate**, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a
  surprise: the codec flag is matched as a STRING CONSTANT, so a flag assembled at
  runtime (an f-string, `"-c:%s" % stream`) or the stream-index spelling `-c:0` is
  invisible to the sweep. Nothing in the tree does that today; an encoder that ever
  needs to must be pinned in `_ENTRY_POINT_PROOFS` by hand, which the inventory test
  makes a visible decision. Separately, ONE mutant survives the round by construction:
  deleting the self-proving membership assertion is catchable only by a meta-test of
  that assertion.
- **`ltx_av` underruns long beats** (found 2026-07-25, codex; confirmed). It caps at
  `_LTX_AV_MAX_FRAMES` (`eng_ltx_av.py:58`, default 497, env-overridable) and clamps
  at `:950-953`. It is NOT "renders to target natively" as three earlier docs claimed.
- **Ping-pong on a capped HuMo beat played lip sync BACKWARDS** -- FIXED in code @
  `a1d810f1`, but the finding is STATIC (no live artifact), so it is NOT a PBUG row. A
  capped-14B leg would reproduce it. Kept here so the live proof is not forgotten.
- **`docs/ENGINE_MATRIX.md` reports the DECLARED contract only** (found 2026-07-27).
  Correct today and consistent with its own stated design (every number read from the
  live registry). But the moment a profile pins an `ltx_8gb` ceiling, the matrix keeps
  printing `9-161 step 8` for a tier whose real window is narrower, and the `--check`
  drift gate cannot notice because it diffs the registry, which the effective contract
  never touches. Owed at the prequalification step, not before.

### Routing, env-capture and the credits card

- **`wants_talking_prompt()` escapes any routing freeze.** It calls
  `_recipe_config(self._recipe())` and `_recipe()` (`eng_ltx_av.py:402-432`) re-reads
  `OTR_LTX_AV_RECIPE` / `OTR_LTX_AV_SHARP` / the UNET name on EVERY call by documented
  design ("Read fresh every call"). So a `required="when_engine_talking"` row evaluated
  through the hook re-reads the environment after capture. S0b-core needs ONE shared
  `row_is_active(...)` evaluator over captured state, with the talking result inside
  `ltx_resolved`.
- **`provider_side` is a THREE-part rule, not an attribute.** `_is_cloud_video_engine`
  accepts a `cloud_` id prefix OR the attribute OR `node_key.startswith("cloud_")`.
  `cloud_kling_avatar` has no `provider_side` attribute and is caught by the id prefix
  alone, so an `engine_facts` builder using a bare `getattr` would classify it local
  and let the radio-host redirect send a cloud avatar to local LTX. Needs a regression
  on picked AND forced `cloud_kling_avatar`.
- **Four env-read sites missing from the S0b inventory:** `eng_ltx_video.py:541-564`
  (`OTR_ENABLE_LTX_I2V`), `render_driver.py:1176-1203` and
  `otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:297-300` (`OTR_ENABLE_HUMO_HOSTS`), and
  `eng_ltx_av.py:352-353,403-432` (recipe/UNET re-read outside `assert_usable`).
- **The credits card needs a SMALL-CANVAS VARIANT, and the ladder is not it.** At
  512x288 (the ltx_8gb tier) col1 is 65px past its footer even with every ledger row
  this policy may drop already dropped; at 640x360 it is 12px over. Both are drawn
  anyway (a terminal node never destroys a finished episode) and LOGGED at ERROR
  naming the canvas -- the old behaviour was drawn, clipped by PIL, silent. At 288
  lines the three-column console is already a polite fiction: col3's scrolling
  transcript is as unreadable as anything col1 clips. This is a DESIGN job -- a card
  laid out for a small canvas -- not more ladder heroics.

### Test-harness and tooling

- **The B7 forbidden sweep cannot see an UNTRACKED file, so a new test file passes the
  gate and fails one commit later.** `tests/test_b7_forbidden_sweep.py` builds its
  input from `git diff s29-clean-slate-gate -- *.py`, which covers tracked files only.
  A new test file added and gated in the same session is green; the moment it is
  committed it enters the diff, and a forbidden runtime identifier in it turns HEAD red
  with nothing else changed. Cost one red HEAD. **Not fixed, because the fix is a
  judgment call:** sweeping the working tree instead of the diff would widen the gate
  to every untouched file in the repo. Cheap mitigation until then -- re-run the full
  suite once after the FIRST commit of any new test file.
- **NOTED, not a defect: two `scripts/` bake-off runners now abort a whole sweep on a
  count mismatch.** `scripts/run_ltx_av_q_bakeoff.py:453` and
  `scripts/run_humo_bakeoff.py:660` call the encoder inside per-leg loops with no
  try/except and DISCARD its return value (both set `result["frame_count"]` from
  `int(frames.shape[0])` independently). A disagreement that was previously invisible
  there is now fatal to the run. That is the correct direction -- a lying count is not
  a leg worth finishing -- but a sweep operator should know it before an overnight run.
- **LATENT, not reachable today: the fewest-segments partitioner can accept a
  disproportionate trim on a WIDE discrete menu.** WIRE-W1 makes `partition_beat` take
  the lowest segment count that covers, including via a permitted tail trim. On a
  ladder that is always the right trade; on a DISCRETE menu whose largest entry dwarfs
  its smallest it need not be -- covering 1019 frames from a `(10, 999)` menu, two
  segments give `[999, 999]` and discard 979 frames where three give `[999, 10, 10]`
  exactly. **A bound was written, MEASURED and REVERTED, and the measurement is the
  point:** rejecting a trim of a whole smallest-clip turned `[12, 12]` into
  `[12, 4, 4]` on a `min=4 max=12 quantum=8` ladder -- a third render and a third model
  load to recover four frames -- across 4,885 cases in the sweep grid. The widest
  shipped menus are Veo's `(100, 150, 200)` and Pixverse's `(125, 200)`, whose worst
  real trim is 25 frames. Revisit only if an adapter declares a menu with an extreme
  ratio; the reasoning is recorded in `coverage_plan.partition_beat` so the next reader
  does not re-derive the bound and re-ship the regression.

### PARKED -- unverified at HEAD, re-observe on the next real render legs
(The 2026-07-24 "after SFX" checkpoint is VOID -- SFX is parked. The re-observe
now rides whatever real render legs come next, D2 included.)

Both were eyeball observations against a story engine that has since had its LLM
vetoes ripped, THE LAW imposed, six banks renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings
retired, the repair-first plan landed, and a ledger cleanup pass added. Neither has a
reproduction at current HEAD, and under the standing rule a finding with no
reproduction is not a row. **Do NOT schedule coder time against either.** They are
settled by the operator eyeballing a real render leg after SFX: still there -> re-admit
as a FRESH dated row with that leg as evidence; gone -> the LAW-era work already fixed
it, tombstone it.

- **Announcer framing defect** (`docs/2026-07-11-announcer-framing-defect.md`).
  Episodes START a story instead of admitting you into one; the announcer takes debate
  turns instead of framing. Operator eyeball 2026-07-11. If it survives re-observation
  the fix is still seam + score contract + fail-closed validator, never Python
  authorship.
- **Name-splice defect #2.** v4-campaign Phase 0 record in HANDOFF_LOG; its timebox
  predates THE LAW.

### Carried administrative rows

- **PBUG-20260710-07** -- root fix shipped; stays ROOT-OPEN in the log until ratified
  at the next operator fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f` is the retire candidate).
- **Phase-2 de-naming** (module filenames, `meta[]` ledger keys, wire-schema `.v4`
  literals) -- DEFERRED, operator-flagged, from the keep-6 rename.

## KNOWN OPEN -- do not rediscover these

* The VRAM admission guard covers coverage-executed beats only; the single-clip path
  returns via `render_shot()` first, and `ltx_audio_in` is not in
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` -- so the hottest-peaking engine is unguarded.
* `FRAME_COST_MODEL` is keyed by engine NAME while recipe/quant/LoRA/reserve are
  env-configurable; a measured row needs a calibration IDENTITY.
* Four adapters still cite missing receipts (`ltx_audio_in`, `mesh_stage`, `viz_green`,
  `viz_mxc_mandala`).
* The HuMo lip-sync onset fix is SPECIFIED but unbuilt, blocked on M1 classification
  (`BUG_BIBLE.yaml:2343`: audio leads the lips by 100-200 ms with the face static for
  the first 3-6 frames). Pre-roll + equal trim is algebraically a NO-OP if the lag is
  constant rather than onset-only, so the classification must come first: early-only ->
  pre-roll fix; constant -> advance the 25 Hz conditioning features; growing -> a
  rate/timestamp bug, not a pad. Run a matched no-LoRA control -- Kijai reports the
  lightx2v distill is not fully HuMo-compatible, so the defect may be ours.
* Cap authority is not yet collapsed to one (`video.max_render_frames` should be sole;
  env twins must be absent-or-equal).
* `otr_w45_campaign.py` runs SIX engines while claiming all local ones, and its
  acceptance would not reject a mirror. Fix before trusting a campaign result.
* The reuse detector cannot separate a deliberately quiet shot from a duplicated frame;
  it is ADVISORY in `otr_w45_campaign.py` until that is solved. The engine-layer and
  composite guards (`MirrorExtensionForbidden`, `ClipUnderrunsItsBeat`) are terminal
  and unaffected.
* `humo_1.7B` and `ltx_8gb` are marked CUDA-only with no fp8, no fp4 and no stated
  reason. Unexamined, not proven.
* M2's raw rows sit in swept `tmp/` with no pinned digest or config manifest.
* `docs/2026-08-02-IDEA-hardware-compatibility-matrix.md` -- captured, not scoped.
  Includes the Mac research: Metal has no `Float8_e4m3fn`, ComfyUI+MPS video is
  impractical (82 min for a 2-second clip), Draw Things and MLX are ~100x faster and DO
  support LTX-2.3 with joint audio, and the `viz_*`/`still_*` lanes need no GPU at all.
* Writer scaffolding repair increments 1-5 -- the spec needs its r3 CORRECTION
  before any code (NEXT CODING QUEUE item 3; the "code-ready" title is stale);
  the reuse detector to the panel; section 0A carve-out ruling before M2 numbers
  move caps; Wan 2.2 I2V checkpoint download + `wan_i2v` re-run; the
  `OTR_CastLock` freeze cascade (`wan_ti2v`).

## MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET (operator, 2026-07-24 -- read this EVERY window)

Every window states, in its first reply, which rung of this ladder it is on and why.
Pick the cheapest tool that can win; escalate only when the cheaper rung cannot decide.
Both pools reset weekly -- front-load heavy coder windows and big Codex spends early in
the credit week; late-week, drop to the $0 rungs instead of grinding a paid pool dry.

| Rung | Model / tool | Cost | Use for | Never for |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Local Qwen on the 4060 (`10.55.0.2:1234`, LM Studio/ACPX): `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct` | $0 | Read-only FIRST-PASS triage of failures, logs, diffs before any credit spend | Final diagnosis, patches, tests, live qualification; NEVER loaded on the 5080 (ComfyUI renders only) |
| 2 | agy / Antigravity, `KIBITZ_AGY_MODEL="Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)"` (DISPLAY name exactly -- a wrong id silently kills agy and the arc runs codex-only; check antigravity.log per round) | $0 | Default grounded reviewer for ALL mechanical review; panelist on every kibitz | -- |
| 3 | Codex CLI `gpt-5.6-sol` (high) | weekly credits | The second opinion of record: the mandatory kibitz panel, pre-execution grounding of big blocks, live-failure kibitz, HANDOFF_CODEX grind delegation | Verify `codex_model_selected.txt` every arc (a stale skill cache once drifted to gpt-5.5 mid-arc unnoticed) |
| 4 | Claude (Cowork, this) | weekly credits | The actual work: planner + coder windows, anchor/judge on every panel, live-run drive | Babysitting renders (the Codex-app overnight monitor owns that); single-small-item windows (batch per Window packing) |
| 5 | Cloud roundtable (OpenRouter) | real $ | Genuine R1 ideas passes only; <$20 autonomy rule applies | Mechanical/grounding review (that is rungs 2-3) |
| 6 | Fable | scarce | Single final gate on a high-stakes structural change (CLAUDE.md section 9 reality exception) | Anything else |

Production (in-pipeline, all $0/local, offline-first): writers = Mistral-Nemo (ctx cap
16384) + `gemma-4-12b` (saved runtime-qualified local default); stills/video-init =
`z_image_turbo` (the Qwen-Image ENGINE is removed -- keep Qwen3/Qwen2.5 LLM support and
Z-Image's `CLIPLoader(type="qwen_image")` encoder, unrelated). Cloud writers stay
opt-in bake-off arms, never the default.

Per-window mapping: RENDER windows = local production models + the Codex-app monitor,
Claude only to launch and wrap. CODER windows = Claude codes, rung-1 Qwen triages every
failure first, and the full kibitz panel is now mandatory per item (see the ON DECK
gate). PLANNER = Claude + the local panel.

## THE LAW (operator, 2026-07-22 -- supersedes anything that disagrees)

> **AN AUDIT MAY IMPROVE A STORY. IT MAY NEVER FAIL ONE FOR LENGTH, LANGUAGE, STYLE,
> VISUAL VOCABULARY, OR QUALITY.**

The sole terminal spoken-prose policy is the shared whole-word safety authority.
Structural JSON/schema/IDs/roster/source-proof/rights/graph/markup/nonempty/
provider-integrity failures remain fail-closed because they protect a usable ledger
rather than judge prose. Across all six banks, requested word length, actual word
count, drift, one-breath estimates, visual/world vocabulary, noun/POS heuristics,
casing/title/honorific style, craft, and quality are guidance or telemetry only -- they
may never reject, reroll, retire, replace, or block an episode. Same-story LLM cleanup
is allowed.

**SUPERSEDED IN PART (operator directive 2026-08-03, `CLAUDE.md`):** the
"whole-word safety authority" above is NO LONGER TERMINAL for episode content
-- no profanity or violence filtering on the generation path, and the source's
own language is carried as written on the adaptation lanes. The paragraph
above is kept as the 07-22 record; its STRUCTURAL half (schema / IDs / roster
/ source-proof / rights / graph / markup / nonempty / provider-integrity
fail-closed) still stands in full. The runtime filters that survived the 08-03
rip are inventoried and queued for removal as ON DECK item 5.

## Standing operator directives (hard)

* **The recipes are not on the table.** "We spent a lot of time perfecting the recipes
  to look good and we can't lose that." No VRAM, speed or cap finding justifies a recipe
  change; measurement runs the SHIPPED recipe unchanged. This specifically forbids
  reading "peak falls as frames rise" as a reason to raise the 97 trained-length cap,
  and makes the deferred no-LoRA HuMo control a recipe change rather than a control.
* **Per-segment rendering is BY DESIGN** -- "each audio clip takes its own journey, to
  keep VRAM low." Never classify an assembled beat as one render.
* **One coder window in the code at a time**, serialized through this file. Two windows
  editing the same file -- especially the workflow JSON -- is how it gets corrupted.
* The remaining hard rules (root-cause fixes, no content guardrails on generated
  episodes, no word-count chasing, the full-kibitz gate, the ledger-completeness rule
  for any ripped LLM pass, git policy) live in `CLAUDE.md` and are not duplicated here.

## Window packing (credit discipline -- one line starts any window)

Starting any window costs the same boot context, so BATCH chunks per window and never
open one for a single small item. Every window starts by pasting its one-line kickoff --
the `otr-handoff` skill reads this file + git and states the current step. No manual
context handoff, ever. This planner window keeps GO_FORWARD + HANDOFF_LOG current;
coder windows never write plans.

| Window | Scope | Rung | Gate | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CODER (open slot)** | The ON DECK queue at the top of this file, in order, one green pushed chunk at a time, each with its full kibitz | Claude codes + judges; kibitz = codex + agy | none -- work it now | ~2h40m + panels |
| RENDER | PARKED by operator directive 2026-08-04 ("no runs right now"). When it resumes: D2 first, then the WAN/8-GB proof obligations | local production + Codex-app monitor | opens when the operator wants a live leg | GPU days |
| PLANNER | Bug Bible operator fan-out + the `check_compatibility` fork; plan upkeep | rungs 2-4 | parallel with any coder window | docs |

**NEVER boot a window by letter.** Boot by the ON DECK section, always:

> resume the OTR build -- you are a CODER window. Read GO_FORWARD "ON DECK" and execute
> THAT queue only, in its stated order, one green pushed chunk at a time, each with its
> full `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` review per the HARD GATE. State your MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET
> rung first.

### If the window is a REMOTE / cloud Cowork session -- READ THIS FIRST

Learned the hard way 2026-07-26. A Cowork session running IN THE CLOUD is not the same
box as the repo, and two of CLAUDE.md's assumptions do not hold:

- **Read/Write/Edit hit the CONTAINER, not the Windows files.** In a remote window every
  read, edit and write goes through Desktop Commander against
  `C:\Users\jeffr\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-OldTimeRadio`, and so does git,
  the venv python and pytest. Everything else in CLAUDE.md holds.
- **There is a LAGGING Linux snapshot at `/mnt/user-data/uploads/`.** Never read the repo
  through it, and say so explicitly to every subagent -- a prior session's agents
  reported phantom corruption from that mount.
- **The bridge can drop mid-edit.** If the remote-device tools vanish, STOP -- do not
  retry in a loop and do not leave a half-applied edit. Report what is on disk,
  uncommitted, and wait. Nothing was lost when this happened because the last green chunk
  was already pushed, which is the actual argument for pushing every chunk.
- **The 60s MCP call ceiling.** The full suite takes minutes, so launch it detached
  writing to a `tmp/` log + a `.done` marker, then poll. PowerShell `*>` redirection
  writes UTF-16, so read results with `Select-String`.

## Parallel lane -- no coder slot required

- **Bug Bible operator fan-out** -- 9+ closed candidates + the duplicate-legacy_id
  cleanup waiting on one fan-out session.
- **Render-window fillers:** cpu-tier smoke (needs the google image lane or stills) +
  nv50 re-soak -- the two open portability remainders; release QA validation time, not
  coding.
- **SFX: PARKED (operator doubt 2026-08-04)** -- no R4.1 re-ground, no C0
  promotion, no Timeline Cue Ledger C0/C1 spend until the operator explicitly
  revives the campaign. The doubt and its reasoning are in HANDOFF_LOG; the
  designs stay in `ROADMAP.md` as evidence, not as a queue.

## Bug Bible promotion field -- pending actions only

| Record | Pending action |
|---|---|
| `PBUG-20260712-22/23/24/25` | Live reverify -- blocked by the `scifi_news` P0 convergence defect, then fan-out |
| `PBUG-20260712-18/19/26` + `PBUG-20260713-15..18` + `-20` | Awaiting the next operator Bible fan-out (overlap check + approval) |
| `PBUG-20260713-19` | Live requalification pending (promoted BUG-05.11) |
| duplicate-id cleanup | Same fan-out: BUG-11.54 legacy_id -> `PBUG-20260713-21`; verify the acronym-union rule's legacy_id (both Bible rows cite `-10`; see the log's renumber note) |
| historical `PBUG-20260711-18` | Keep as a standing context/cap engineering risk; never eligible from static evidence |
| `PBUG-20260710-07` | Ratify retirement at the next fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f`) |

The active production-fix owner updates `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`; the approval queue is
`docs/BUG_BIBLE_PROMOTION_QUEUE.md`; no plan review or invented fixture creates a row.

## Validation and handoff law

- **Current whole-tree receipt (2026-08-04 @ `dcd5a53b`):** full Windows suite
  **8398 passed / 131 skipped / 1 xfailed** (4:07); Bug Bible green. Prior receipts live
  in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` -- this file keeps only the current one.
- Every code chunk: focused tests, full Windows suite, Bug Bible, AST/JSON/BOM/zero-byte
  checks, commit, push, verify `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.
- Every node/widget/link/schema change edits `workflows/otr_canonical.json` in the same
  commit and runs `OTR_WorkflowValidator`, JSON round-trip, strict link/input, live
  widget-vector, and generated-variant audits.
- Reset selectively before every headless run; never blanket-kill Python. Every run loads
  the canonical workflow and writes directly to canonical episode/OBS paths. Asset
  existence, not resident VRAM, proves completion.
- One coder edits code or `workflows/otr_canonical.json` at a time; read-only audits and
  documentation may run in parallel. HANDOFF_LOG + this file are the only tracking
  surfaces.
- **Count the suite on a clean tree:** `build_variants.py --all` also emits variants for
  any UNTRACKED profile on disk, and some profile checks are parametrized over the
  variants present, so another window's scratch profiles can inflate the number by a
  dozen tests that would not reproduce on a fresh clone.

## Open risks

- **NO CLIENT BANK HAS EVER RUN LIVE.** Every extensibility wave is proven by the suite
  and by contract tests, and the first real client bundle is still an unproven path end
  to end (fetch -> interpret -> writer -> cleanup -> tail -> publish). Treat the first
  live client-bank leg as a qualification, not a formality. Deferred power-user tiers
  (client own-runner + staging, dependency manifest, standalone story_rules) are
  explicitly OUT of v1 and are a NEW block if the operator ever wants them.
- **CLIENT-AUTHORED PYTHON executes in-process** (wave 3). The posture that must hold in
  every future change: `--activate` is the consent act; the seam fails LOUD
  (`UserBankExecutionError`) and never substitutes; client code never touches the
  canonical ledger; owner IDENTITY is verified so a bank can only run its OWN bundle; the
  shipped fetcher/interpreter registries are never widened to admit a client id. Do not
  relax any of these for convenience.
- **The client-facing surface is LIVE TEXT, not just docs:** the `custom_source_bank`
  row's `guide_ref` is raised to the operator by `require_runnable_bank`, and the
  `source_bank` tooltip repeats it. Any future change to the activation path (folder
  name, CLI verb, restart behaviour) must update `nodes/story_packs/banks.json`, that
  tooltip and `docs/EXTENDING_OTR.md` together, or the product will confidently instruct
  clients to do the wrong thing.
- **`check_compatibility` is RESERVED, not wired** -- operator/planner decision flagged,
  with a 2-of-2 recommendation to RIP (codex and Fable independently, Claude grounded
  both). The argument that decided it: the "it reserves the name" benefit is FALSE --
  `BUNDLE_ENTRY_ATTRS` constrains what OTR-side code may request from
  `bundle_entry_point()`, it reserves nothing against clients, and activation provably
  ignores whatever a client puts under that name (`tests/test_otr_check_cli.py:335`
  asserts a bundle whose `check_compatibility` is a plain integer activates). The only
  artifact that reserves the name is the `EXTENDING_OTR.md` paragraph, which exists
  either way. Case AGAINST: churn on landed green code for zero behaviour change, and the
  plan of record already names the future consumer (randomizer eligibility). Blast radius
  if ripped: ~5 code sites, 2 test files, 3 docs; no workflow JSON, no routing, no
  source-payload consumer. **Not a coder chunk** -- either ratify the inert constant or
  schedule the rip as a planner chunk. Proposed doctrine line: a name published to
  clients before its consumer exists lives in the client-facing DOC as "reserved, no
  contract, ignored if defined" and nowhere in executable code, because code that names
  an interface is read as enforcing it.
- **The ledger-cleanup pass runs on EVERY bank, not just client banks** (`3d97a130`). It
  is a no-op on a complete ledger and costs no LLM call there, but two shipped-lane
  behaviours did change and are worth watching on the next live legs: (a) unsafe spoken
  language on a `content_owned_readonly` bank is now REPAIRED at the writer tail instead
  of reaching G9 untouched, so a leg that used to die at freeze may now ship a sanitized
  line; (b) a blank `meta.episode_title` is now filled at the tail instead of exploding
  later in `otr_credits_roll`. Both are the intended direction under THE LAW; neither has
  a live receipt yet.
- No code lands mid-sweep of an active qualification campaign (the 420-rung
  uniform-code-confound lesson).
- `dynamic_story` touches the writer, the visual-style authority and the canonical
  workflow; it re-derives the live JSON at build. It is the only claimant on those
  surfaces.
- Generated-SFX R4 stays local/ignored evidence; the whole SFX campaign is PARKED
  (operator doubt 2026-08-04) and the R4.1 refit does not run unless the campaign
  is explicitly revived.
- Lean-mean front/tail drift: the constraint holds wherever it runs -- the tail's SW-1
  re-survey is mandatory against the then-current writer, and the two campaigns never
  share a window.

## Tombstones -- the only three a window might wrongly revive

Full list in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` + `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`. These three are
here because each has been re-proposed at least once:

* **The 20 fabricated-fixture `public_domain` episodes and the fixture itself** --
  operator ruling 2026-08-04: dropped and deleted, **never raise again**.
* **v4 improvement campaign banks #2-#5** -- PARKED, superseded by the keep-6
  rename + THE LAW. Revive only by operator decision
  (`docs/2026-07-17-v4-campaign/final.md`).
* **LEAN-MEAN** -- lives in `ROADMAP.md`, not this file. A window that wants to
  rip dead code is on the wrong document.
