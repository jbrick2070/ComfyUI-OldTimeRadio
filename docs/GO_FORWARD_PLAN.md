# OTR Go-Forward Plan

**Forward-only.** Open work, live bugs, standing operator rules, the budget ladder.
Completed work lives in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` (newest at top) and every prior
revision of this file is in git. If a thing is DONE, it does not belong here.

## REVIEW ROUTING FOR THE BUG-FIX WINDOW (operator 2026-08-15 -- READ FIRST)

**`kibitz` IS BACK ON AND IS TOP OF MIND.** The operator restored the panel for
this sprint and named the roster himself: **`/kibitz-plugin:kibitz`** (the
PLUGIN skill by name -- `anthropic-skills:kibitz` is the older duplicate),
**Antigravity / Flash 3.7**, and **Sonnet + Fable subagent FAN-OUT** for
diagnosis and fixes. This supersedes the 2026-08-11 suspension for this work.

**You still take your own QA, and you remain the judge:**
> *"You take your QA -- if you think you found it on your first pass, make your
> own fix and have Sonnet or Flash 3.7 QA and code and retest."*

So: a defect you are confident about on the first pass gets YOUR fix, then a
Sonnet-or-Flash QA-and-retest pass on the finished diff. Anything you are NOT
confident about goes to the panel BEFORE you write code. Ground every panel
claim against the real Windows files and discard what does not survive.

**THE ARC FOR THIS SPRINT ALREADY RAN (2026-08-15) -- do not re-run it.** Four
rounds, 14 external reviews, output =
`docs/2026-08-15-BUILD-CONTRACT-bugfix-sprint.md`. Provenance, stated precisely
because a partial campaign may never be reported as a full arc: Codex covered
all four rounds; **Antigravity covered r1 ONLY** and was quota-held
(`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` 429) through r2-r4, recovering only afterwards; the cloud
panel (GPT-5.6-sol, Gemini 3.1 Pro, DeepSeek-v4-pro) covered r1 and r3; Fable,
Sonnet and Haiku covered r1. Cloud spend $0.36 total.

**The panel gate for the REMAINING chunks is the diff-level one above** -- your
fix, then Sonnet/Flash QA on the finished diff -- because the design is already
panelled. Open a fresh arc only for a chunk that departs from the contract.

**BASELINES to detect drift (updated 2026-08-16 EVENING):** suite
**10584 / 110 / 1** (chain: 10529 -> 10550 chunk B step 1+2 -> 10567 the TTS
preflight gates + the two defects they caught -> 10584 chunk B step 3. Earlier
that day: 10751 -> 10765 with chunk A's 14 tests -> 10529 after the scifi_news
rip deleted 13 dedicated lane test files and the rename trimmed the polluted
re-import test), Bible
**20 / 26 / 3**
(the Bible now holds **284** entries -- `12.103` landed with chunk 2, `12.105`
with chunk 3.5, `12.104` with D2's transaction, `12.106` with the P5R token
budget), variants 50 emitted (3 refused -- the standing unratified cloud
profiles). (10532 -> 10561 specification session; -> 10608 chunk 0.5; -> 10610,
10613, 10624 the three agy QA rounds; -> 10633 chunk 2 / D1; -> 10657 chunk 3.5
/ D3; -> 10683 D2's transition schema + the rename fix; -> 10711 D2's emitter +
transaction; -> 10729 D4's sidecars + the P5R budget fix; -> 10732 the P5R
chunking fix; -> 10736 the sidecar re-fetch carry-forward; -> 10740 the QA
round; -> 10748 the unisex retirement; -> 10751 the given-name mention fix.
No regressions at any step.)

**A Bible entry now costs a README bump.** The survival-guide repo enforces a
Three-File Contract -- `BUG_BIBLE.yaml`'s entry count must equal the count cited
in `README.md`, in three places -- so adding an entry and not touching the
README turns `tests/bug_bible_regression.py` red (20/26/3 became 19+1F/26/3 on
`12.104` until the README said 283). Bump both in the same commit.

**THE REVIEW ORDER IS QA -> FABLE -> PUSH, AND SKIPPING THE FIRST STEP COST
REAL DEFECTS THIS WINDOW.** The routing block at the top says *"make your own
fix and have Sonnet or Flash 3.7 QA and code and retest"*. This window ran
suite -> push -> Fable -> Sonnet, i.e. both reviews landed on code that was
already on origin. Both found defects, and the CHEAP one found the worse bug:
* Fable: the P5R fix was HALF a fix -- sizing the request to the actual scene
  still dies whenever the model draws a 7-8 beat scene, which the P3 prompt
  literally invites. Cost: commit `cab94644` cleaning up `5194ab90`, plus a
  Bible amendment, where one correct commit and one entry would have done.
* Sonnet: `scripts/otr_stamp_character_genders.py:111` called `infer_gender`
  with ONE argument where it takes two and returns a TUPLE -- a plain wrong
  arity that would `TypeError` and kill the whole 65-unit run the first time a
  cast block parsed. It shipped inside a commit whose message asserted that
  tier "works". A QA pass catches that in seconds; Fable did not.
Run the QA pass on the finished diff BEFORE the push, and before spending Fable.

**NEVER EDIT A TRACKED FILE WHILE THE SUITE IS RUNNING.** Cost this window: two
phantom regressions (`test_p0_deterministic_repair_wired`,
`test_scifi_candidate_liveness`) that both pass clean on a settled tree. Several
tests AST-parse `nodes/*.py` off disk, so a mid-run edit produces a torn read
that looks exactly like a real break and costs a full re-run to disprove. Start
the suite, then keep your hands off the tree until it reports.

**THE MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET LADDER IS EMPTY.** The table at the "MODEL & CREDIT
BUDGET" heading below has a header row and a separator and **no rows under
them**, so the rungs every window is asked to cite do not exist in this
document. Windows are currently answering from the per-window mapping paragraph
beneath it. Either restore the rungs or retire the instruction; asking each
window to state a rung from an empty table is a question with no answer.

## THE 08-15 BUG-FIX SPRINT IS CLOSED -- receipts live elsewhere, rulings live here

D1/D2/D3/D4 and chunks 0/0.5/A are DONE and live-proven; the receipts are in
`docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` and `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`, the remaining contract
chunks are queue item 3. What SURVIVES here is only what still binds future
work:

* **Web search is ALLOWED at vendor time** (operator 2026-08-15, stated
  twice; the RSS precedent).
* **Gender drift is ACCEPTED** -- the deterministic ladder is the ANSWER, not
  a stepping stone. Do not loosen the decision margin (floor 4, ratio 3x):
  DOROTHY of Oz measures 8/3 male under a looser estimator because her scene
  is crowded. A confident WRONG pin must stay impossible; decline-and-roll is
  the accepted behaviour.
* **Fidelity is owed only where a source states something.** `original` may
  ship a male JANE (operator accepted); the adaptation lanes may not ship a
  wrong AHAB. Pool mode cannot produce a mismatch (every pool name carries a
  definite tag); `llm_slot_fill` stays OFF; the deliberate lever for
  on-purpose cross-gender names is `OTR_NAME_CROSS_GENDER_RATE` (default 0).
  `unknown` behaves like the retired `unisex` in the guard -- a trapdoor
  under a door nobody opens; do not reopen.
* **DETECTOR TRAP (cost a window once):** ledger LINES key speakers by
  `char_id`, never name -- but frozen post-audio ledgers may DROP char_id on
  lines. Resolve identity from the CAST row, then match lines by whatever
  key the era carries.
* **Shakespeare gender supplement is keyed by FOLGER CODE** (`Tmp`, `MND`),
  never slug -- probing by slug reports phantom zero coverage.

### THE ORDER, DRIVER-SET 2026-08-16 LATE (supersedes the 08-15 list order;
### the numbered bodies below are the reference detail, this is the sequence)

**OPERATOR RULING 2026-08-16 (latest, supersedes every eyes-gate below):
ALL Lemmy/video listen-and-eyeball sessions are DEFERRED -- "we can get eyes
after all sprints are coded since I will be remote." Code items 1-4 STRAIGHT
THROUGH on the driver's picks; nothing waits on his ears.** Every artifact
that wanted eyes ACCUMULATES into one batch review for his return:
the Lemmy cross-engine listen page, the el_harry-vs-el_daniel elevenlabs
verdict (provisional pick = `el_daniel`, the only bank-tagged British male;
`el_harry` stays flagged for the batch listen), the Q5_K_M-vs-Q3 A/B clips,
chunk B's forced-hit cameo episode, and the soak's best/worst shortlist.
Provisional rows land WITH receipts saying they are provisional; his ears
can demote any of them later without archaeology.

1. **Lemmy on every TTS engine** (item 1.1) -- **THE ARC IS DONE. THE PLAN IS
   THE CONTRACT: `docs/2026-08-16-lemmy-cross-engine-PLAN.md`**, hardened
   through a full four-round `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` campaign (Codex all four
   rounds; Antigravity r1-r3 plus a retried r4 after a narration-only pass --
   artifacts under `kibitz-runs/2026-08-16-lemmy-cross-engine*/`). Read it
   instead of re-deriving. **The bank half is already LANDED** (the mirror
   generator now owns only the keys it produces and mints the two Lemmy clone
   rows; `873c24b1`). What REMAINS is the tier itself: the separate
   `provisional_native_routes` key, the sibling resolver, the two CastLock
   stamp branches, the transition normalizer, the `IS_CHANGED` fingerprint,
   the cross-engine harness with waveform normalization, and ONE canonical leg
   on kokoro. **Four findings from that arc are load-bearing and are stated in
   the plan; do not rediscover them the hard way.**
2. **Chunk B, the cameo roll** (item 1) -- **STEPS 1, 2 AND 3 ARE DONE AND
   PUSHED** (`7faf3bf7`, `b46db68e`). The widget reaches the lanes, the
   decision API exists, and `scifi_news_pro` casts, voices and receipts the
   cameo. **ALL THAT REMAINS IS STEP 5: the acceptance leg** -- reset the box
   per CLAUDE.md section 4, boot a FRESH server at the implemented HEAD (a
   stale boot proves nothing), then one forced-hit leg via
   `--set "OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.lemmy_cameo=always include"` (that widget IS
   on the creative whitelist, unlike the engine widgets). Acceptance criteria
   are in the contract's step 5.
3. **Video sprint** (item 1.2, RECONCILED with the lab 2026-08-16 -- see the
   updated body) -- `ltx_distilled` lane + verbatim-viseme injection +
   kinetic-on-video-path, with the Q5_K_M quant as a SIBLING VARIANT. Needs
   the LTX boot, so it pauses the soak; one arc covers the sprint doc.
4. **The Shakespeare wrong-play frame family** (section D, measured twice by
   the blind read) + the assembly-lint class (speaker-tag leaks, truncated
   closers). Correctness on the fidelity lane; panel before code.
5. **Upscaler prep** (item 1.3) -- candidate downloads run in the BACKGROUND
   under any of the above; the two `_resolve_model` hardenings ride along.
   Then the operator's own 4060 full-stack pass (gate already open).
6. **Finder `--judge`** (item 1.5 remainder) -- GPU-idle filler, never
   during renders.
7. **PBUG-20260815-11** (item 2) -- stays queued; does not jump.

Standing tail unchanged: the bug-fix contract's chunks 4/5/6/D7, and the
shakespeare supplement rows (item 4).

**1.1 LEMMY ON EVERY TTS ENGINE (operator 2026-08-16: "we need to be sure we
have lemmy working on all tts engines", NO-SKIP directive, and "audition"
means BUILD IT -- "do your best to get a lemmy going").** Measured: he has a
real identity on 2 of 7 character engines (bark `v2/en_speaker_8`; indextts2
qualified route). The DECIDED matrix (driver-decided on the operator's
delegation, correcting the no-skip draft against the tree):

| engine | route | state |
|---|---|---|
| indextts2 | qualified clone -- ALREADY DONE, do not re-train | shipped |
| bark | `v2/en_speaker_8` | shipped |
| google_tts | **`gt_algenib`** -- his own source voice (gravelly, F0 97 Hz); NOT Neural2-D, which is a Cloud-TTS id our Gemini integration cannot reach | map it |
| chatterbox | clone the approved wav (rights scope already covers "local engines") | build |
| dia | clone the approved wav (same rights) | build |
| kokoro | `bm_george` -- warmest British male; a friendly-broadcaster cousin, NOT Cockney, accepted under no-skip | map it |
| elevenlabs | verify `el_harry` (bank tags him AMERICAN -- tag or recollection is wrong); `el_dave` is not in the bank | listen first |

Build shape: extend `LEMMY_VOICE_POLICY.approved_native_routes` per engine +
bank rows where needed; render his canonical audition lines per engine off
the G1 harness (`scripts/otr_g1_lemmy_audition.py` pattern) into ONE listen
page; the operator's ears confirm; then the policy rows land. Coding item ->
full `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` arc on a short plan doc BEFORE code (the
bug-fix-sprint diff-level routing was scoped to that sprint).

Historical framing of the sprint, kept for context:
PBUG-20260811-03 was re-confirmed on that session's own artifacts and its SCOPE
GREW: `cast_contract` is ABSENT (the key is never written -- the `{}` in
earlier notes was a probe's `or {}` fallback rendering) and the cameo is
missing on BOTH content-owned lanes, not just `scifi_news`. Read the refreshed
entry and its 2026-08-16 corrections at the end of `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` before
planning.
Three things that will save a wasted swing: the obvious fix (route content-owned
lanes back through `lock_cast()`) is explicitly THE WRONG ONE and the repair
belongs in each lane runner; the fix is TWO things, the cameo roll and the cast
contract; and PBUG-20260811-01 is **CLOSED AS MIS-ATTRIBUTED (2026-08-16)** --
at the repro commit the cameo widget was provably inert on that lane (dispatch
returns before `lemmy_force` is even computed) and the two leg logs contain no
"lemmy" at all, just stochastic Mistral-Nemo markup non-compliance -- so
"forcing the cameo kills the fable2 writer" is WITHDRAWN as a constraint on
cameo work. PBUG-20260811-02's cause is no longer open either: root cause
ESTABLISHED in the log (pre-audio still planning plus a reservation that
suppressed itself in both branches); the entry stays OPEN only pending live
proof of the repair.
The operator also asked for a full six-bank live sweep and a tag once it passes
-- three banks are proven at tag `otr-2026-08-15-d2-closed`
(`scifi_news`, `scifi_news_pro`, `public_domain`); `shakespeare`,
`media_archive` and `original` are NOT.

**TWO OPERATOR CORRECTIONS (2026-08-15) THAT CHANGE HOW THIS IS MEASURED --
full text at the END of `PROD_BUG_LOG.md`:**

1. **Do NOT measure the cameo by PRESENCE.** That question is answered: Lemmy is
   cast 190 times and speaks in 188, identity stable throughout (`c02`, male,
   `v2/en_speaker_8`, fixed Cockney signature). The two silent castings are from
   June and pre-date the current code. **The open variable is the SIZE and
   fidelity of the part** -- and that is a LATER, quality-side item, explicitly
   NOT in this sprint. The sprint is the STRUCTURAL `scifi_*` gap.
2. **DETECTOR TRAP, read before writing any verifier.** Ledger LINES identify the
   speaker by `char_id`, never by name; Lemmy is always `c02`. Matching the
   string `"LEMMY"` against a line's speaker field reports him silent in 188 of
   190 -- a near-total false negative the operator hit and caught himself.
   Resolve his `char_id` from the CAST row (which DOES carry the name), then
   match lines on that id.

**SWEEP PASS CRITERIA FOR THE CAMEO (2026-08-16, from the full-corpus ledger
census -- write this into the sweep verdict so the expected result is not read
as a failure):** in the current era Lemmy appears ONLY on `media_archive` (last
2026-08-15) and `original` (last 2026-08-10); every other bank stops in July,
and every `scifi_*` bank id has ZERO castings ever. Expected per bank:
`media_archive` / `original` -- the cameo MAY appear (11% OS-entropy roll;
absence on any single leg is NOT a failure); `public_domain` / `shakespeare` --
NO LEMMY row, contract stamped with `lemmy_policy=source_fidelity_exclusion`;
`scifi_news_pro` -- until chunk B lands, NO cameo, and the stamped contract
is REQUIRED (chunk A landed `da44f642`, live-proven): `lemmy_hit: false` +
the content-owned no-roll policy. (`scifi_news` was RIPPED 2026-08-16 and is
no longer a sweep lane.) Lemmy absent on the scifi pair is the EXPECTED state, not a
regression signal.

**Repair site: ONE runner module** -- `_otr_scifi_fable2` (the codex runner
was deleted with the 2026-08-16 `scifi_news` rip).

**THE SPRINT SPLITS IN TWO, AND ONLY ONE HALF IS SAFE TO BUILD BLIND
(scoped 2026-08-16, no code written):**

* **Chunk A -- the cast contract. CONFIDENT, build it first.** Both runners
  stamp a real cameo DECISION (`lemmy_hit`, `lemmy_policy`, the counts) even
  though the lane owns its cast. This closes the SILENT half: today the key is
  omitted entirely, so a reader cannot tell "declined" from "never asked". The
  repo already states the rule these lanes break -- `_otr_casting.py:1852-1854`:
  *"ONE stable shape on EVERY lane -- the invention lanes stamp an empty
  contract rather than omitting the key, so a downstream reader never has to
  distinguish 'no source' from 'field never written'."* No render-path behaviour
  changes and no cameo appears; provable without a GPU.
* **Chunk B -- the cameo ROLL. Still panel it, and the design space is now
  MEASURED (2026-08-16, three-agent verification, every claim driver-grounded
  against the tree).** The altitude question is settled by construction: the
  roll must be decided BEFORE the script pass, because both lanes derive cast
  FROM the finished script and both gate on it -- fable2's gate (b) demands
  speaker set == cast rows and codex's `cast_coverage` gate demands every cast
  id scheduled, so post-script injection fails structurally. The old blocker is
  GONE: PBUG-20260811-01 is closed as mis-attributed (widget inert on the lane,
  no "lemmy" in either leg log), so there is NO known writer/cameo interaction
  to design around -- the proof obligation is simply that a cameo-bearing cast
  passes both gates on a live leg. What remains a genuine fork, and why the
  panel is still owed: the two lanes need DIFFERENT designs. Codex is
  SCHEMA-LOCKED -- `char_id`/`voice_slot` Literals + cast `max_length=4`
  (`_otr_scifi_codex.py:277-286`), the id vocabulary repeated in `BeatPlanV4`
  (:488), `RadioScoreDraftBeatV4` (:551, itself grammar-decoded in P3),
  `ScriptLineV4` (:797) and the `_DRAFT_SPOKEN_CHAR_IDS` gate (:1221, enforced
  :1352); the LMFE grammar on the local provider rebuilds from the models
  automatically -- so a cameo either DISPLACES one of the three story slots or
  widens five schema sites (no test pins the Literals; the lock lives entirely
  in the production module). Fable2 has headroom: `MAX_SPEAKING_CAST = 10`, no
  id vocabulary, no grammar binding -- a cameo needs no schema edit, but it
  consumes one of the 10 live voices and MUST speak (the casting validator
  demands exactly one entry per script speaker).
* **Neither runner mentions Lemmy at all** (zero occurrences in both files), so
  this is NEW construction in two places, not a wiring fix that regressed.

**1.2 VIDEO ENGINES SPRINT -- RECONCILED WITH THE LAB 2026-08-16.** Authority:
`docs/2026-08-16-video-lab-proposal-GROUNDED.md` + the lab's answers to
`docs/2026-08-16-TO-THE-LAB-reconcile-video-proposal.md`. The lab WITHDREW
three rows on receipt of the evidence: both H3 engines ("no material
difference; we missed the `public_engines.py` alias mapping"), the 848x480
legacy-resolution claim (came from LTX upstream defaults, not OTR), and HuMo
Clamp-13 (peak-VRAM-only evidence, no abort-rate data -- refused by the
recipe rule). The reconciled transplant list is THREE items:

* **The `Q5_K_M` quant, correctly framed (operator 2026-08-16: "there are no
  defaults, we have multiple video lanes... I'm going to ship w/ multiple
  JSONs").** OTR's LTX-AV lane loads `ltx-2.3-22b-dev-Q3_K_M.gguf` through
  the `OTR_LTX_AV_UNET` env override, so: TESTING Q5 is zero-code (set the
  env, run a leg, measure); PRODUCTIZING it is a SIBLING VARIANT JSON /
  profile, never a swap inside the shipped lane -- no recipe-rule collision
  by construction. **Source: VERIFIED by direct HF listing, not by search
  result.** The dev-DiT file is
  `unsloth/LTX-2.3-GGUF / ltx-2.3-22b-dev-Q5_K_M.gguf` -- **16.07 GB**
  (a UD-Q5_K_M sibling exists at 18.3 GB). The lab's suggested
  `QuantStack/LTX-2.3-GGUF` has NO Q5 file (checked); `city96` is v0.9.1,
  wrong architecture. The DISTILLED quant ladder (for the NEW lane, if its
  GGUF option is wanted above the on-disk Q3) is
  `Abiray/LTX-2.3-22B-DISTILLED-1.1-GGUF` (Q3 14.7 / Q4 17.8 / Q5 19.4 /
  Q6 21.0 / Q8 25.5 GB). Note 16.07 GB means dev-Q5 is a 16 GB-card weight
  with offload -- the lab's "8 GB baseline upgrade" framing needs its 4060
  peak-VRAM receipt before anyone repeats it.

* **BUILD: the `ltx_distilled` sprint/draft lane.** Every prerequisite is on
  disk (22B fp8 transformer 23.5 GB, both VAEs, Gemma-3 encoder, ltxv LoRA).
  16 GB lane (13.11 GiB measured), rides the LTX sage-free boot token.
  **Sample-path folded in (operator 2026-08-16):** the lab-proven recipe IS
  the new lane's starting spec -- `res_multistep` sampler, `simple`
  scheduler, 20 steps, denoise 1.0, 832x480 @ 25 fps, frames 8k+1 up to 193
  (7.72 s), first/last-frame chaining. No sampler change to any SHIPPED lane
  is proposed and none would be accepted without the operator reversing the
  recipe rule. Engine selection for acceptance goes through a capability
  profile (`role_overrides`) -- the engine widgets are managed.
* **BUILD (additive): P1's verbatim-dialogue half** -- inject the actual
  spoken line into the video prompt on the audio-in lanes so the encoder can
  predict visemes. Rewrites nothing; the no-rewrite ruling is untouched.
* **DECIDED (driver, on the operator's delegation): P1's kinetic half goes on
  the VIDEO-prompt path** (`_otr_line_composer` / the motion clause), as
  ADDITIVE motion language -- no damping-word stripping anywhere, so
  `otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py`'s ruling (:1706-1707, survived the
  2026-08-05 r4) is not touched. Revisit condition: if measured damping
  persists after video-path injection, the still-path stripping question goes
  BACK TO THE OPERATOR as a ruling change; it is never slipped in.
* Coding item -> full `kibitz-plugin:kibitz` arc on the sprint doc BEFORE
  code. Acceptance legs need the LTX boot lane, so they pause the soak.

**1.3 UPSCALERS + THE 4060 FULL-STACK GATE.** Operator 2026-08-16: multiple
upscalers need downloading and testing; the FULL-workflow + TTS + image +
upscaler pass on the physical 4060 8 GB happens ON THE MAIN REPO "once we
are ready w/ low vram updates done". **The low-VRAM gate is ALREADY OPEN**
(see 1.2 -- the lanes shipped), so that test is gated only on the upscaler
work. Constraint from runway row 4: the multi-GPU learned-upscale STAGE is
CLOSED and must not be reopened -- this item is (a) pick + download candidate
ESRGAN-family models (web lookups allowed per the 2026-08-15 ruling;
downloads can run in the background any time), (b) harden the two
`SpandrelEsrgan._resolve_model` edge cases if still reproducible, (c) rotate
the candidates through the EXISTING stage on this rig, soak-profile style.
The 4060 run itself is the operator's, on his schedule.

**GPU SOAK (LIVE as of 2026-08-16 ~14:53).** `scripts/otr_gpu_soak_matrix.py`
is cycling 1-act legs, 5 banks x 10 styles x 10 engine profiles (all five
still-family video engines x all five local image engines, rotated through
committed `otr_soak_*` capability profiles that never emit variants).
Receipts: `otr_soak_receipts/soak_*.json`, rewritten after every leg.
**READ THE RIGHT RECEIPT (2026-08-16 evening, PBUG-20260816-03).** Three
harnesses are live and ONE OF THEM RENDERS NOTHING:
`soak_20260816_143448.json` holds **708 legs, every one failed in ~12 seconds**,
because that launch rotates the engines with `--set` on MANAGED widgets and
`patch_creative` refuses them before submission. The real progress is the 8
legs in `soak_20260816_143704.json` + `soak_20260816_145333.json` (6 passes,
42-minute legs, `--profile otr_soak_*` -- the sanctioned lever). **The tag gate
must be judged on those, never on the 708.** The failing harness was left
running deliberately: it holds no GPU and it is operator-ordered state.
**Leg 1 already FAILED usefully** -- the 4th live UNKNOWN_SPEAKER ladder
exhaustion (PBUG-20260816-02, `scifi_news_pro`); the soak is now the
incidence-rate measurement that PBUG's correction said was missing. Do
not theorize a fix from n=1; read the receipt's rate first. Stop:
kill the `otr_gpu_soak_matrix` python (and any in-flight
`otr_canonical_api_run`). A post-rip/rename TAG is READY once the soak
receipt shows every bank passing -- operator-gated, one word.

**1.5 STORY-QUALITY FINDER: v1 SHIPPED 2026-08-16 (`a1f1577b`), operator
jumped it mid-sweep ("quick scoring now").** `scripts/otr_story_score.py`
scored all 1,692 frozen ledgers deterministically (structure only; THE LAW
holds -- telemetry, never a gate, length unweighted). Calibration: the
operator's own `reel_of_mystery` exemplar ranked #2 of 1,692 unaided.
Sonnet QA verdict SHIP; its five findings (incl. a corpus-proven 27%
news-lane coda bias) were fixed before the push. Reports land under
`otr\episodes\_shared\state\story_scores\`. **REMAINING: the `--judge`
pass** -- one local `gemma-4-12b` "keep listening? 1-10" call per
SHORTLISTED episode (judge the candidates, not the corpus), GPU-idle only,
never during renders. The flag exists and refuses politely until built.

**2. PBUG-20260815-11 -- UNBLOCKED 2026-08-15 BY A NARROWED RULING. Build it
AFTER the Lemmy sprint, the six-bank sweep and the tag -- it does not jump the
queue.** 34 characters sound one gender and look the other, measured over 1,686
real ledgers.

**WHAT THE OPERATOR PERMITTED, and it is narrower than the option that was put
to him.** The ruling STANDS AS WRITTEN for the PORTRAIT PROMPT path: nothing
downstream of casting may reject, rewrite or block a prompt, and **node 89 gets
no classifier**. What is permitted is upstream and different in kind -- in
`_otr_casting.py`, where the comment at `:365-369` already states that gender is
a Python-decided fact the LLM writes into, **the description producer may check
its own returned prose against the gender it was handed and RE-ASK.** Bounded
retries, then keep the last answer: **a render must not die, so it degrades
rather than raising.**

Neither r4 blocker applies, which is why this is buildable where the 2026-08-05
proposals were not: we never reach back from node 89, and we add no new field
for `Ledger.set_cast` to drop.

**Acceptance:** prove it on a live leg and re-run
`scripts/audit_voice_gender_consistency.py`. **34 portrait conflicts is the
BEFORE number.**

Do NOT put a classifier at node 89, and do NOT edit the ruling comment away.

**3. The contract's remaining chunks**, `docs/2026-08-15-BUILD-CONTRACT-bugfix-sprint.md`
is still the authority: chunk 4 (D5 non-media codas), chunk 5 (D6 selector +
reservation), chunk 6 (D5 media_archive close), and D7. D1/D2/D3 are done.

**4. Shakespeare's 24 unresolved rows** (CALIBAN, ARIEL, Sir Andrew, the
mechanicals). The sanctioned instrument is ten more curated lines in
`roster_gender_supplement.json`, keyed by FOLGER CODE (`Tmp`, `MND`), not slug.
Both r1 reviewers independently said do NOT point a model at this lane.

**NOT scheduled, deliberately:** the local-LLM gender tier. Two r1 reviews
designed it in full (evidence packages from mention windows, LMFE-constrained
JSON with "undetermined" first-class, quote-verification against the on-disk
text, a content-keyed cache) and the measured verdict is that it is machinery
without a customer at 65 frozen units. Revisit only if the corpus starts growing
in bulk -- the straggler list is a measured artifact, printed by running
`scripts/otr_stamp_character_genders.py` with no `--write`.

### A. THE CLOSING ANNOUNCER DOES NOT NAME WHAT IT ADAPTED (3 banks, one family)

| bank | what shipped | what is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `shakespeare` | `spoken_coda_source: none`, closes *"We've lost our signal."* | names NOBODY -- not the play, not Shakespeare |
| `public_domain` | coda fires, says the literal words *"public domain work."* | never names the title or the author |
| `media_archive` | coda type `news_close_brief` | it is an ARCHIVE bank (LoC / Film Preservation posts) being asked to summarize a news story it never had |

**The shakespeare row needs an OPERATOR RULING ON WORDING before it is coded.**
It looks like an over-application of the 2026-08-05 licensed-source ruling:
that ruling stopped the announcer reciting a LICENCE, and its own reasoning was
*"Folger publishes the edition and Shakespeare wrote the play"* -- yet what
shipped also stopped it naming the author and the play. Naming Shakespeare is
not a licence claim. Ask before writing the sentence.

### D. NO LONGER UNDIAGNOSED -- the wrong-play frame is MEASURED, twice

`tempests_midnight_revelations` was the suspicion; the 2026-08-16 blind
narrative read is the measurement
(`docs/2026-08-16-blind-bank-narrative-ranking.md`): a Twelfth Night scene
announced as *"Verona ... Capulets and Montagues"*, and a Tempest scene
framed as Romeo and Juliet -- both current-era `shakespeare` episodes. The
announcer FRAME is sampled independently of the selected excerpt instead of
being generated from the same metadata record. FIDELITY defect on the lane
where fidelity outranks arc; deterministic root shape; same family as the
speaker-tag leaks, corrupted-text lines and truncated closers the same read
surfaced. A real fix candidate for the next coding window -- panel it first
(the root cause is diagnosed by SHAPE, not yet traced to the exact sampling
site).

### OWED -- the Bible promotions, one per green chunk

The delta-scrape is DONE and must never be re-run (it cost ~4M tokens once).
Seven uncovered shapes are drafted as `12.103`-`12.109` in
`docs/2026-08-15-BIBLE-PROMOTION-DRAFT-bugfix-sprint.md`, each with an
automatable verify clause and its index row; 02(b) needed none, already covered
by `11.18`.

**They are deliberately NOT promoted yet.** A Bible entry's `fix:` field claims
something was fixed and proven, so each one lands WITH its green chunk per the
contract's documentation gate. Also note PBUG-20260815-07 is a REJECTION,
recorded so nobody re-chases the `original`-lane voice report.

## OPERATOR RULINGS 2026-08-15 (hard -- these settle three OWED decisions)

**THE EPISODE SHAPE IS A REQUEST, TOP TO BOTTOM. NOT THE BEATS, NOT THE ACTS.**
*"It's like chasing words again -- no chasing beats."* *"We ask for x beats, we
do our best, we don't fail if it doesn't have exactly as many beats."* *"If it
writes 1 act [when] I request 7, fine."* This is the word-count law extended to
every structural number: nothing may refuse, reroll, retire or clip an episode
for the count it came back with, and **no test may pin one either** -- a test
that asserts "an act is exactly N beats" is the same gate with pytest holding
it. Direction is checkable (asking for more must never ask for less); size is
not. In practice the act count is guaranteed by CONSTRUCTION anyway -- the
outline runs one authoring pass per arc phase -- so only the beats inside a
path are the model's answer.

**NO HARD SCHEMA CEILING MAY SHAPE A SPINE.** *"If I ask for 7 acts it needs to
generate a spine of 7 acts."* `_RADIO_SCORE_MAX_SCENES = 3` x
`_RADIO_SCORE_MAX_BEATS_PER_SCENE = 4` was a hard 12-beat cap on a WHOLE
episode at ANY act count, and the score's scene is that lane's act-sized unit
-- so a 7-act pick could not produce a 7-act spine, and because the lane
decodes under a grammar built from the schema it TRUNCATED mid-generation
rather than refusing. Caps are DERIVED from the topology now
(`MAX_ACT_COUNT * _SCHEMA_HEADROOM`, `BEATS_PER_ACT * _SCHEMA_HEADROOM`), so
raising the topology carries the schema with it. They stay finite: runaway
guards remain code-side.

**AN ACT IS 4 BEATS, AND EVERY ACT IS AN ACT PATH.** *"Ideally we say each act
is 4 beats and we have a separate LLM pass per beat."* `BEATS_PER_ACT = 4`,
with `voiced_beats_per_act` DERIVED from the arc phases so the two cannot
drift. This fixed two inversions in the old hand-tuned table: 7 acts asked for
19 beats while 6 asked for 20, and 3 and 4 both asked for 14. Per-beat
authoring passes were already shipped (`per_beat_dialogue_then_scene_review`).
**Cost, measured:** ~1.7 min/beat story-only on `gemma-4-12b-it`, so 3 acts
runs ~12 beats and 8 acts ~32.

**`media_archive` IS ALREADY LIVE RSS** (Library of Congress + National Film
Preservation feeds, fetched every run) -- the defect was that it always took
pooled entry 0, so it retold the newest post forever. Ruling: pick it *"similar
to [the] science news picker"*, which means the three mechanisms that lane
already ships -- dedup against `news_history.json` so a story is never told
twice, a MODEL ranking candidates by narrative fit, and recording the choice --
not the seeded shuffle first proposed. **OPEN.**

**THE `__main__` SELF-TEST BLOCKS: DELETE THEM.** *"If they aren't doing
anything delete em."* **OPEN.**

## PRIORITY 1 -- STORY CLEANUP. The clean stage SHIPPED 2026-08-14.

**Forward-only.** What this section used to carry -- the build narrative, the
diagnosis, the measurement tables -- is DONE and lives in the
2026-08-14 CODER entry of `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md`. What is left below is what is
still open, still ruled, or still dangerous.

### WHAT SHIPPED, in one paragraph, so nobody rebuilds it

`nodes/_otr_ledger_clean.py` runs once from
`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter._run_writer_tail`, just before
`_otr_ledger_cleanup.run_ledger_cleanup` -- the ONE producer boundary all six
banks reach. A MODEL judges every spoken row for anything that is not speech;
a MODEL rewrites what it names, told the judge's own words plus the act, the
speaker and the lines BEFORE AND AFTER. Bounded at two attempts, then the best
rewrite ships flagged. Python never writes a word: the four calls that set row
text all write a string the model returned, through `set_line_text_metrics`.
`scripts/otr_clean_stage_lab.py` is the measurement rig -- a planted bad ledger
per bank, shaped per lane, scored on recall AND false alarms.

### THE SHIPPING RECIPE, measured -- do not re-derive it

**Whole-line judging on `gemma-4-12b-it`.** 13/15 recall, 24/28 traps kept,
13 rows repaired, 79 calls. The clean stage has a MODEL FLOOR exactly like the
news lanes do: on `gemma-2-2b-it` precision collapses to 61% and it repairs
less than half as much while spending MORE calls.

**Rejected by measurement -- do not re-propose without new evidence:**
agreement voting (-4% precision for +45 calls); the load split as a quality fix
(neutral, marginally cheaper, kept available as `REPAIR_READS_BRIEF_ONLY`);
per-sentence judging on a large model (strictly worse than whole-line there).

**`JUDGE_PER_SENTENCE` is a real lever and it is OFF.** It is the only thing
that ever broke the 13/15 recall ceiling -- 15/15 on the 2B, by shrinking the
JOB rather than improving the prompt. It costs precision, and specifically it
costs `shakespeare` (2/5 traps) and `public_domain` (2/4), which is where the
operator ruled a false positive IS a real defect. Turn it on only for a forced
2B run where recall beats politeness.

### CHARACTER DRIFT IS ACCEPTED. DO NOT CHASE IT. (operator 2026-08-14 -- HARD)

*"We just accept character drift, don't chase. Be honest in the README -- note
that if they want to chase it, they need a frontier model above what my 16 GB
card can do."*

**F2's CONTENT half is CLOSED as a work item** -- not parked, not a TODO. It
was built, lab-tested on the shipping model, failed, and ships disabled
(`JUDGE_ATTRIBUTION = False`). Recall swung **3/6 then 1/6 on identical
fixtures with a byte-identical judge**; it never once caught `role_claim` or
`knowledge_mismatch`, and the "same words, right mouth" trap fooled it both
runs. A detector that unstable cannot be trusted with a rewrite.

Documented honestly in `README.md` under "Known limitation: character drift",
including how to enable it and how to MEASURE it
(`scripts/otr_clean_stage_lab.py --f2 --model <...>`).

**Reopening it requires NEW EVIDENCE, and that means one thing only:** a
measured run on the F2 fixtures showing a model both accurate AND stable across
repeats. This does not reopen the 2026-08-04 story-quality law -- character
consistency is still carved out of it as a correctness defect. We measured what
fixing it costs on this hardware and the operator priced it.

**F1 -- action in a spoken row -- remains ON and is the shipped capability.**

### DO NOT "FIX" `clean_spoken_text`. THE OPERATOR RULED ON IT 2026-08-05.

An earlier cut of this file ranked it the worst no-shims violation in the tree.
**That was wrong**, and acting on it would have broken a working design.

`_otr_captions.py:19-40`: performance direction is shown on purpose. A caption
burns the RAW ledger line while TTS independently strips it via
`clean_spoken_text`, so caption and audio diverge BY DESIGN -- 255 cues across
95 of 915 shipped episodes, *"a nice easter egg as long as it's built and we
know and it's documented"*, pinned by `tests/test_otr_captions.py`. And the raw
text is load-bearing on the visual side: `_otr_motion_clause._line_text_index`
reads raw `lines[].text` for the i2v motion clause under *"the line drives the
motion"*, plus the still prompt and the HUD.

It is a two-surface design: `lines[].text` is the canonical direction-bearing
record, the microphone gets a projection of it. The no-shims law is about who
may WRITE the record; the TTS strip writes nothing back. The 80/40 character
caps are deliberate bounds on deletion power, not a latent bug.

**What would reopen it:** a live episode where the regex deleted words a model
had BLESSED as genuine speech -- greppable as rows where
`clean_spoken_text(text) != text` with no `unclean_spoken_text` flag and no
policy finding. Narrow the net then; never remove it.

### OPEN -- the one no-shims violation that survived the rip

The 2026-08-14 audit found three; the 2026-08-16 `scifi_news` rip closed two
(codex `P5R _call_scene_review` and `_canonicalize_script_spoken_text` died
with the module). One remains:

* **`_otr_content_safety.py` is dormant but loaded** -- hardcoded
  `PROFANITY_TERMS` / `EXPLICIT_WEAPON_TERMS` / `EXPLICIT_NUDITY_TERMS`
  (`:25-82`) driving model rewrites, contrary to the 2026-08-03 no-guardrails
  directive, plus two bare `RuntimeError`s (`:328`, `:334`) that would kill a
  render. Nothing calls it. Delete it or rebuild it before anything wires it
  back.

### OPEN -- a tension the clean stage created, worth one look

The clean stage REWRITES `lines[].text`, which is the field the 2026-08-05
ruling calls load-bearing for stills and i2v motion. It degrades gently -- the
repair FOLDS the action into the speech rather than deleting it, and
`compute_source_hash` includes the dialogue so a changed line correctly
regenerates its motion clause -- but two rulings now pull on the same field
from opposite ends. **Look before the clean stage is trusted on a VIDEO leg;
it does not affect the audio path.**

### OPEN -- the model floor should REFUSE, not grind

A model that cannot satisfy a lane's contract should be refused at the top of
the run WITH THE REASON, not discovered after 34 minutes of bounded retries.
Measured: `gemma-2-2b-it` drove `original` at act 3 to a clean ledger in 5.1
minutes and could not get `scifi_news` past P0 in 34. It was not a runaway --
it was bounded, honest, futile work. **The defect is the silence, not the
floor.** Proven for `scifi_news` / `scifi_news_pro`: `gemma-4-12b-it` and
`Mistral-Nemo`. Do NOT delete `gemma-2-2b-it` -- it is the fastest writer-lane
model on the box.

### OPEN -- F1's last miss class

The three surviving misses on the 12B are all `scene_report`: a scene sentence
and real dialogue sharing one row ("The monitor flatlines. Someone should call
the desk."). The per-sentence lever catches them and costs precision elsewhere;
a calibration example for the MIXED row is the cheaper thing to try first.

### OPEN -- still suspect, deliberately not fixed

The codex lane carries the cap-equals-trim shape on `MAX_FACT_ROWS` (6) and
`MAX_ENTITY_ROWS` (4). That lane decodes under a grammar, so the ceiling
TRUNCATES during generation rather than refusing -- silent evidence thinning,
not a crash, and unproven on an artifact. Six facts and four entities is tight
for a real news story. **Prove it on an artifact before touching it.**

### RULED OUT BY MEASUREMENT -- do not re-propose without new evidence

| Rejected | Why |
|---|---|
| `repetition_penalty` | **inert here**, up to its maximum -- HF's penalty is not frequency-aware |
| `no_repeat_ngram_size` | unusable with the grammar -- the ban and the mask both write `-inf`, the intersection can be EMPTY and sampling crashes |
| lower temperature | helped one run, failed another. Not reliable |
| agreement voting on the clean judge | -4% precision for +45 calls |
| per-sentence judging on a 12B | strictly worse than whole-line there |
| a whole-episode "final table read" pass | the `PBUG-20260814-03` failure shape in reverse -- a small model handed a whole episode averages it into a summary |

## CURRENT RUNWAY -- OPERATOR-ORDERED 2026-08-13. WORK IT TOP TO BOTTOM.

**ROW 1 BELOW IS SUPERSEDED by PRIORITY 1 above (operator 2026-08-14).** Its
order was "resume the upstream Story Lab and A/B against it"; the lab is now
parked, read-only and being retired, and the story work happens in production.
Rows 2-5 are unchanged and still run in their listed order, behind PRIORITY 1.

This block is authoritative. It supersedes every older order, count, Lemmy gate,
and review-routing sentence lower in this file. Re-ground the active row against
the Windows tree before editing; when a row is coded, fully tested, committed and
pushed, move its receipt to `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` and remove it from this forward
queue in the same push.

| # | Active work | Exit condition |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **SUPERSEDED -- what remains is PRIORITY 1 at the top of this file** | Do NOT restart from the Story Lab. |
| 2 | **Give LEMMY a fighting chance: complete Phases 2-4 and its three live PBUGs** | Preserve the Cockney floor with one upstream engine-policy authority wired through the canonical workflow, CastLock and renderer; qualify real routes by operator-audition receipts; close the six-engine gender-only pin gap; restore or explicitly decline `scifi_news` cameo policy; resolve the fable2 BAD_LINE interaction; re-observe the missing closing before diagnosing. No silent substitute and no defined-but-unwired policy. |
| 3 | **Run seven fresh post-change 45-word render proofs** | All seven exact public engine IDs pass against the post-bugfix/post-Lemmy HEAD with `COVERS`, `RESULT SUCCESS`, server `Prompt executed` + `obs_publish OK`, and the canonical OBS asset on disk. See **WHAT IS ACTUALLY LEFT** below. |
| 4 | **Narrow learned-upscale hardening only** | Harden the two `SpandrelEsrgan._resolve_model` edge cases if still reproducible. The multi-GPU learned-upscale stage itself is CLOSED and must not be reopened. |
| 5 | **Release runway** | `ROADMAP.md`: lean-mean -> RunPod/AMD/Mac -> install -> product docs/v2 release. |

### THE STORY LAB IS RETIRED -- two guardrails survive it

The lab ([`jbrick2070/ComfyUI-OTR-UpstreamStoryLab`](https://github.com/jbrick2070/ComfyUI-OTR-UpstreamStoryLab),
`main` = `7df7c80`) is READ-ONLY reference. **Do not develop in it. Do not ship
its duplicate workflow, production mirror or bridge into OTR.**

Its two detector files were inventoried and NOT ported, deliberately:
`spoken_text_policy.py` and `ledger_verifiers.py` are both REGEX detectors --
the lab's own header says *"a future fuzzy or model-assisted policy requires a
new policy"* -- so porting them would not solve the generalization problem the
model judge was built for.

**The canonical `scifi_news` episode topology STANDS and is still the
contract:** opening music -> ANNOUNCER introduction -> character drama
with interstitial music only where the script asks -> ANNOUNCER source-backed
real-news summary -> closing music. Both announcer bookends and the opening and
closing music are structural reservations independent of `target_words`. The
opening establishes story, place and time and connects the premise to the news;
the ending summarizes the real news and distinguishes fact from fiction.

## ON DECK -- WHAT REMAINS OF CONTINUITY CORRECTNESS

### 0-QUINQUE. MINIMAX H3 -- A SPRINT SERIES ON THE VIDEO PATHS (operator, 2026-08-09)

**THE RULING IS IN, AND IT DISSOLVES THE OLD QUESTION.** This section used to
say the next step was an operator ruling on "does H3 belong in the video
dropdown given the 4 s floor vs the sub-4 s beats". That framing is RETIRED.
The operator's 2026-08-09 direction: H3 is **"a series of sprints all to refine
the video paths"** -- scope TBA.

**What that changes for a window picking this up:**
* It is NOT a yes/no dropdown admission any more, so do not go looking for a
  verdict to record. There is nothing blocked on the operator here.
* The unit of work is a SPRINT against the video paths, not a one-shot chunk.
  Expect several, each with its own kibitz gate, each landing green and pushed
  on its own.
* The 4 s floor is now an INPUT to that refinement -- a constraint the video
  paths have to accommodate or explicitly route around -- rather than a
  disqualifier that settles admission.

**Scope is TBA and that is deliberate.** Do NOT invent the sprint list. When the
operator names the first sprint, write it into THE QUEUE at the top of this file
as its own row, and leave this section as the standing context.

**Grounding that survives the reframing:**
* Problem statement `docs/2026-08-03-PROBLEM-STATEMENT-minimax-h3.md` is
  UNTRACKED and another window's working file -- never stage, edit or delete it
  from a different window. Read it; do not touch it.
* The matrix-pattern spec already names MiniMax as a churn driver
  (`docs/2026-08-06-SPEC-subsystem-matrix-pattern.md` section 5), so a video-path
  sprint will likely collide with the un-converged matrix work (section 0). Read
  that section's "what survived all four rounds" before designing anything.
* The recipes are NOT on the table (standing directive). A video-path sprint
  refines PATHS -- routing, canvas negotiation, admission, extension -- never
  the shipped render recipe.

### 1. The reference A/B still owes a verdict (the one real open item)

The reference path is PROVEN WIRED, not proven EFFECTIVE. Live leg
`signal_lost_lute_strings_fools_tongue_20260805_021040` shows three `scene_character`
rows stamped `portrait_anchor_mode='reference_latent'`, and the two rows sharing char
`c03` share one anchor -- so the engine declared the capability, the portrait row
resolved, the file was on disk, and the anchor entered the cache key.

**What nobody has answered: does `z_image_turbo_nvfp4` actually ATTEND to the prepended
reference, or does it accept and ignore it?** The architecture takes it with no missing
weights (header probe: `cap_pad_token` and `x_pad_token` present, `siglip_embedder`
absent), but graph shape cannot prove three faces became one. That needs:
- a control arm with **`OTR_PORTRAIT_REFERENCE=0`**, on its own fresh server boot --
  env vars cannot reach a resident ComfyUI process, and `OTRImageGenDispatcher` has no
  `IS_CHANGED` to notice the flag, so the arms MUST NOT share a boot;
- the control asserts `portrait_anchor_mode == 'seed'`, NOT `''`. The seed pin is still
  enabled in that arm. Only setting BOTH `OTR_PORTRAIT_REFERENCE=0` and
  `OTR_PORTRAIT_IDENTITY_SEED=0` yields `''`;
- an operator eyeball on the two arms, which is the actual verdict.

If the reference turns out to be a no-op, **Track 2 Step 8 (flux2_klein)** is the built
answer -- klein is genuinely reference-trained and its weights are on disk. It is
deliberately NOT built yet. Switching to it is a Director widget pick, not code.

### 2-PRE. OPERATOR CALLS ALREADY MADE -- do not re-open, do not re-panel

**BANANA ROUTE: VISUALS ONLY. The spoken script is NOT touched
(operator ruling 2026-08-06).** Operator, asked whether the filter should reach
spoken lines as well as image prompts: *"No. Just visuals. I do not want people
discussing the Cavendish versus the other variety."*

So the substitution happens on the STILL/VIDEO PROMPT and nowhere else. The
announcer still says "he drew his revolver" over a shot of a man holding a
banana -- which the problem statement flagged as either the joke or the thing
that breaks it. It is the joke. **The dialogue ledger, the writer, and the
adaptation lanes are all out of scope**, which also keeps this clear of the
closed story-quality directive and of the fidelity lanes' invents-nothing rule
at the TEXT level.

This closes the second half of section 7 of
`docs/2026-08-06-PROBLEM-STATEMENT-banana-route.md` (committed `9c686886`).

**THE DEFAULT AND THE REACH ARE ALSO RULED NOW (2026-08-06, `ec9da848`) --
that question is CLOSED, do not reopen it.** Global default **ON**, with
`shakespeare` + `public_domain` defaulting **OFF** via the copied `_LEMMY`
exclusion idiom, plus `OTR_BANANA_INCLUDE_FIDELITY_BANKS` as the operator's
force-on override. **NO node widget and NO `workflows/otr_canonical.json`
change.** So `Is this a dagger which I see before me` stays a dagger on the
fidelity lanes unless the operator flips the override. Two env switches
(`OTR_BANANA_STILLS`, `OTR_BANANA_VIDEO`), one per funnel. The whole contract is
`docs/2026-08-06-BUILD-SPEC-banana-route.md` at `ec9da848`; SHIPPED -- see
section 0-QUATER above (`bc8a1bde`).

### 2. Operator calls nobody can make for you

- **ARIEL and PUCK.** The curated supplement ships 10 entries and deliberately omits
  these two: Folger's stage directions use "he" for both, but neither has a roster fact
  and both are editorial. They stay on the roll, so the corpus gate asserts 40 of 42.
  Say the word and they become 42.
- **Tier floor 2 or 3.** Shipped at 2: it removes every 100% voice pin while 5 of 24
  (engine x gender x timbre) combos still honour the requested timbre. Floor 3 also
  removes them but leaves only 2 of 24 honouring timbre -- it buys spread by deleting the
  dimension. `OTR_CAST_MIN_TIER_POOL=3` makes it a one-leg A/B, and the floor is folded
  into the cast seed so the two settings can never both claim policy '3'.
- **`num_characters` is still 2.** Every published adaptation ran 2, so a 7-speaker scene
  loses five people. Correct gender for two survivors is still a truncated scene. This
  collides with the count-match invariant at `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4119` and is its
  own piece of work, not a tail of this one.

### 3. Standing facts worth not re-deriving

`slot.gender` is NOT a voice field. It feeds the description LLM
(`_otr_casting.py:777`), the outline prompt (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4144`), the
dialogue cast block (`_otr_line_composer.py:446`) and the image prompt's gender anchor
(`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:78-90`). **The gender fix therefore changes scripts and
portraits.** That is a downstream consequence of a correctness fix, not a violation of
the closed story-quality directive -- exactly as "Malvolio speaks with a woman's voice"
is a bug while rewriting his dialogue is not.

Do NOT feed pinned genders into `prior_genders`, and do NOT re-call
`_plan_gender_distribution` with a reduced count. Measured: `(1, ['male'])` returns
female 400/400, and the shuffle's stream consumption varies with count (getrandbits
0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 11 for counts 0..5). The shipped design overrides in place and leaves the
allocator untouched.

**Source-grounding sprint, the one piece left:** chunk 3b-ii -- the supply line
that feeds grounding into the writer -- is BUILT-BUT-UNWIRED and PARKED under the
story-quality directive. The delivery mechanism exists and nothing calls it. A
contributor may pick it up; chunk detail under THE CODING SPRINT item 1.

## THE CODING SPRINT (operator directive 2026-08-04; re-sized by the r1-r4 arc)

Item 1 is the structural work and consumes most of a session; items 2-3 are
small and share one campaign. Items 8 and 9 are DONE (receipts in
`docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md`). The live open work is sections 0 (video matrix pattern,
did NOT converge), 0-BIS (no-mirror, CODE-READY), 0-QUATER's deferred
shield-scoping chunk (own kibitz arc), and the 0-QUINQUE MiniMax ruling.
Work by priority, not by number -- the numbering is historical.

**RENDERS HAVE RESUMED** (2026-08-05). The 08-04 "no render runs this session"
line is spent -- it governed that session only, and the 08-05 handoff opens on a
live-proof obligation. Reset per `CLAUDE.md` section 4 before any leg: selective
CIM kill by CommandLine, never a blanket python kill (it severs the MCP tooling).

Everything below was verified against the real files on 2026-08-04, is
non-GPU, and is provable by the suite alone. Work them in order; each ends
green and pushed on its own.

### 1. THE PUBLIC_DOMAIN LANE IS TOLD TO CARRY WORDS IT IS NEVER SHOWN (the session's main work -- r1 panel re-scoped 2026-08-04)

The headline defect, and the one that manufactured "Arkham, Massachusetts" over
H. G. Wells. The pack orders the model to carry the author's language:

* `nodes/story_packs/public_domain/faithful_radio_adaptation.json:13`
  (`exchange_system`) -- "Where the source gives these characters words, CARRY
  THEM. Keep their diction, their rhythm, their argument."

And `nodes/_otr_compose_exchange.py` (994 lines) has **ZERO** references to
`source_text`, `full_text`, `source_meta` or `excerpt` -- verified by grep.
**The instruction is bound to an absent document.** A model told to carry words
it cannot see will invent words and believe it complied.

**SCOPE RULING (r1, grounded against `docs/2026-08-03-fidelity-pass-ownership.md`
line 25): this item is PUBLIC_DOMAIN ONLY.** The ownership table rules
`exchange_compose` **NOT RUN** on the Shakespeare verbatim lane ("It exists to
author dialogue. There is no dialogue to author."), so enhancing the composer
for Shakespeare invests in a pass the verbatim executor removes. Shakespeare
gets exactly ONE change this sprint: its dangling comma (item 3). The keystone
"compile source speech, do not generate it" (THE ADAPTATION DESIGN) binds the
VERBATIM lane; `public_domain` is the operator-ruled FUZZY PROSE lane, where
grounding the generative composer is the correct move, not a contradiction.

Three legs, ALL required -- the panel killed the raw-injection shape:

**(a) A BOUNDED source window over the COMPLETE canonical body -- never the
payload's `full_text`, which is itself truncated.** r2 correction of this
plan's own premise: `canonicalize_public_domain_text(..., max_chars=12000)`
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:337-343`) truncates at 12,000 CHARS, and
`payload_from_manifest_unit` stores THAT as `full_text` -- while the corpus
runs **916 words (`cradle_protocol`) to 25,200 words (`beckoning_fair_one`)**
across 65 units. So "the material already arrives, it needs passing" is false
for large sources: the payload carries a prefix. The selector reads the
complete canonical body from the SOURCE layer, separated from the interpreter
excerpt. Hash discipline: exactly ONE of 65 units ships a provenance sidecar
(`time_machine__arrival.provenance.json`), and its `body_sha256` covers
normalized RAW bytes, not the canonicalized body -- two NON-interchangeable
fields. Derive a `canonical_body_sha256` at fetch/selection time, bind
selection + receipts to it, and do NOT call it authenticated provenance. Do
NOT migrate the 65 closed manifests for it (`_SOURCE_KEYS`/`_UNIT_KEYS` closed
at `:48-63`); carry it in `source_meta` and snapshots. Coordinate system (r3):
refactor `canonicalize_public_domain_text` into an UNCAPPED normalization
owner plus a separate 12,000-char legacy payload projection; spans are
half-open Unicode char offsets (`start_char`/`end_char`) into the uncapped
string; `canonical_body_sha256 = sha256(canonical_body.encode("utf-8"))`;
stamp normalization + selector versions. Transport (r3): `SourceFetchResult`
exposes only payload/source_meta/source_rights and `_resolve_inputs` collapses
to a three-tuple, and the snapshot envelope is the SEVEN-KEY payload
(`_otr_source_snapshot.py:48-50`) whose `full_text` is the truncated prefix --
so extend the PUBLIC-DOMAIN snapshot with the CANONICAL BODY as the SOLE
replay authority (r4 cut the "or exact selected text" alternative -- selected
text cannot recreate pre-outline grounding or select windows for a NEWLY
generated outline), under a versioned body/hash/normalization contract. A
legacy seven-key snapshot FAILS with a typed grounding-version error -- but
ONLY when the snapshot's bank is `public_domain`/adaptation (r4, both lanes
converged): the seven-key envelope is the UNIVERSAL loader, and an
unconditional rejection would break every other bank's existing snapshots and
bake-off replays. Keep the full document OUT of meta/ledger (`source_meta` is
copied into durable metadata at `:3548`). Budget: capacity
is EVERY backend, not GGUF alone -- the fitting seam
(`_otr_generation_budget.py:132`) spans GGUF (`estimate_prompt_tokens`,
estimator, `_otr_gguf_backend.py:1264-1273`), OpenRouter, Google and Comfy --
so select the window against the COMPLETE assembled message (system seam,
cast, prior lines, contracts, source block, output reservation), reserve
conservatively with stated margin, and refuse `prompt_no_room`
deterministically BEFORE provider execution; receipts distinguish
estimated_prompt_tokens / requested_output / context cap / margin / estimator
version. Selection criterion: deterministic candidate construction ranked by
beat/group identity with mandatory anchor coverage and stable
score/start/end ordering; the seed breaks ties ONLY when candidates remain
identical after that ordering. Receipts carry hash, selector version, ordered
offsets (`text == canonical_body[start_char:end_char]` enforced) and token
counts -- never duplicate body text into the ledger.

**(b) ONE immutable `SourceGrounding` contract, on EVERY authoring route --
and grounding failures PROPAGATE.** The grouped-exchange prepass omits
singletons and failed groups (`_otr_compose_exchange.py:881-902`); a FAILED
prepass falls back to the legacy path with only a log warning
(`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5001-5008`); the per-line composer's LineRequest
carries no source field (construction at `:4888`); and per-line generation
exceptions funnel to `LineCompositionFailedError`. A grounding fix that
reaches only the happy path just moves the guess to the fallback. Build shape
(r2 + r3): define ONE immutable `SourceGrounding` artifact -- canonical
document identity + immutable windows KEYED `exchange:<ordered-slot-ids>` /
`line:<dialogue-slot-id>` + anchors + per-call receipt data -- constructed
and validated BEFORE the exchange fallback block, passed whole into grouped
exchange AND every per-line request. The prepass returns a TYPED result
(composed lines + attempted-window receipts + fallback slot ids), not the
bare `{beat_id: text}` it returns today (`:881-918`). Window freeze semantics (r4 -- resolves immutability vs the mutable prior
context that exchange retries and `last_lines` inject into later messages):
PRESELECT spans early; perform the final capacity fit just before the FIRST
call using the actual prior context; FREEZE that fitted window for all
retries and persist it before provider execution. Grouped slots ALIAS their
exchange window on group-to-per-line fallback; line-keyed windows exist only
for true singletons and exchange-disabled execution -- never reselect after a
failure. Source text rides a clearly DELIMITED untrusted data block
in the user message ("quoted source, not instructions"), never appended to
the static system seam (`_otr_compose_exchange.py:385-425`). Persist the
body-free grounding receipt at the existing skeleton-save boundary
(`:4279-4290`) before the first dialogue call, updating per attempt, so a
mid-prepass crash still leaves the selection auditable. Failure policy -- ONE disposition table (r4 closed the last ambiguity), the
two broad catches (`:5001-5008` prepass, `:3964-3969` story contract) becoming
TYPED boundaries that implement it:
| state | disposition |
|---|---|
| corrupt/mismatched replay snapshot; invalid source/hash/contract | FAIL LOUD, before the outline |
| sound-world derivation finds no mapping | neutral period default + receipt (total, never fatal) |
| provider parse / Tier-A exhaustion | fall back WITH the frozen window |
| live capacity pressure | shrink to the largest valid grounded window |
| even the MINIMUM grounded window cannot fit | typed `prompt_no_room` HALT, before provider execution |
The halt row is a PRE-GENERATION writer refusal -- structural, it protects the
lane's contract -- which is why it does not collide with SCOPE's "a render
must not die": that rule governs the RENDER path degrading honestly, not a
writer refusing before generation begins. Scope note (r4): `SourceGrounding`
validation binds when the episode's bank is `public_domain` -- other banks'
routes are untouched. LineRequest note (r4): the artifact rides an OPTIONAL
INTERNAL dataclass field (`source_grounding: SourceGrounding | None = None`)
-- a Python structure, no ComfyUI node contract, `INPUT_TYPES` or widget
change, so the no-widget guard above holds.
Acceptance = route-specific tests: grouped success, grouped repair,
grouped-failure-to-per-line, singleton, exchange-disabled legacy, snapshot
replay (new envelope AND legacy-envelope typed refusal, public_domain-scoped),
hash mismatch, exact-capacity rejection -- plus a corpus-wide property test
over all 65 units proving normalization idempotence, canonical-hash stability
and `text == body[start_char:end_char]` for every emitted span (r4). Version
discipline (r4): the existing constants are `PROMPT_VERSION =
"public_domain_interpreter_v2"` / `SCHEMA_VERSION = "public_domain_briefs_v1"`
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:36-38`); name and bump every changed one, and
give SourceDocument / SourceOverview / SourceGrounding / normalization /
selector / snapshot their own explicit versions.

**(c) World anchors, DERIVED FIRST -- and the sound world gets ONE owner that
feeds every surface.** Prefer deriving a typed grounding sidecar from EXISTING
metadata + the selected spans. New manifest fields are a LAST resort:
`_SOURCE_KEYS`/`_UNIT_KEYS` are closed frozensets
(`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:48-63`, same for `_SCENE_KEYS`), so new fields
mean a schema version + migration across all 65 units. AND the competing frame
must actually be disabled, not outvoted: the adaptation `sound_world` is a
content-blind draw (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3962`, palettes at
`_otr_style_catalog.py:442-463` -- grate/mantel/teacup over whatever source
rolled it). r2 sharpened the shape: the catalog renders the drawn sound world
into `contract.grammar` SEPARATELY from the `contract.sound_world` stamp and
the canon derivation, so a stamp-only fix leaves the prompt grammar still
carrying the contradictory palette. ONE source-aware derivation function must
feed the stamp, the grammar and canon for `style_pool_class == "adaptation"`
(arc_shape gate at `:4325` is the shipped precedent), with an explicit neutral
period default when no mapping exists -- and it runs BEFORE the grammar is
built (or the grammar re-renders from the final contract), or the prompt
grammar keeps the contradictory palette while the stamp looks fixed (r3, both
lanes independently). DECIDE whether derivation failure is fatal: today's
broad catch silently disables the whole story contract. Reconcile with the
EXISTING anchors owner: `meta["specificity_anchors"]`
(`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4259-4266`) already derives and injects an anchor
projection -- the new source anchors REPLACE it or deterministically merge
into it, never run beside it as a second independent voice. Do NOT delete the
adaptation styles -- operator-authored 2026-07-14; fix the DRAW and the
plumbing, not the styles.

**Two receipts, named now so neither is overstated later:**
* `code-complete + suite-green` -- the most a session without the live leg can claim.
* `production-qualified` -- only after a canonical `public_domain` leg passes a
  rubric: no unsupported foreign place/character/object; the source's setting
  and principal event retained; provenance receipt complete; `obs_publish OK`;
  asset on disk.

**Two rules from the 08-03 craft brief, both hard-won, both easy to violate:**
1. **Never name the feared failure.** Writing "no Arkham" into a prompt IMPLANTS
   Arkham. Forbid by CATEGORY, never by example.
2. **Every fidelity instruction must be PAIRED with the material it binds to.**
   An unpaired "carry the words" is the bug, not the fix.

**Size honesty (r1) and CHUNK ORDER (r3 -- the naive order was CYCLIC):** this
is THE SESSION, not 90 minutes. r3 caught a dependency cycle in the obvious
build order: the sound world feeds `contract.grammar`, the grammar is consumed
by the OUTLINE (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3948-3963` -> `:4129`), and beats do
not exist until the outline returns -- so a sound world derived from
beat-keyed windows is impossible. Build in THIS order, one green pushed chunk
each:
**CHUNKS 1 AND 2 ARE DONE AND PROVEN ON RENDERS. Chunk 3 (the grounding supply line) is PARKED under the story-quality directive -- the Source-grounding note in section 3 above is authoritative; a contributor may pick it up.**

**Carried into chunk 3 from the chunk-2 QA (do not lose):** snapshot replay
has no whole-body carrier, so an adaptation lane replaying a frozen source
falls back to the drawn palette and a live run and its replay produce
different sound worlds. The tempting fix -- rebuild the document from the
snapshot's `full_text` -- is WRONG and was rejected: that field is the
truncated projection, so it would mint a document whose total-coverage
guarantee describes a prefix. The correct fix is the snapshot-envelope
extension already specified in 1(a) below.

1. **Uncapped `SourceDocument` + a pre-outline `SourceOverview`** (r4): split
   the normalization owner, then derive deterministic COVERING windows with
   exact-span evidence for cast, setting, principal turns and ending. This is
   what grounds the PRE-OUTLINE authors -- the interpreter today reads the
   CAPPED payload (`_otr_public_domain_sources.py:520-543`, running at
   `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3748-3757`) before contract (`:3948`) and
   outline (`:4129`); beat-keyed grounding alone arrives too late for them.
   Transport (r4): ONE transient typed field --
   `SourceFetchResult.source_document` -> typed normalized result ->
   `resolved["source_document"]` -- MECHANICALLY excluded from meta/ledger
   serialization; snapshot replay reconstructs the same type.
2. **Contract / grammar / outline from the overview's document-level
   anchors**: the one derivation function runs BEFORE grammar build (or
   grammar re-renders from the final contract), feeding stamp + grammar +
   canon. Pre-outline derivation uses DOCUMENT-level anchors only -- selected
   spans do not exist yet (r4 wording fix).
3. **Beat-keyed window selector + `SourceGrounding` threading + typed failure
   boundaries** (post-outline, when beats exist). The route matrix must NAME
   the announcer routes -- intro / rewrite / outro authoring at
   `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5104-5116`, `:5272-5285`, `:5357-5409`
   (verify-at-build) -- and decide per route: grounded, or constrained to
   already-grounded accepted fields.
No node signature, widget, link or schema change is intended anywhere in this
item -- the canonical JSON stays byte-identical through the sprint; if any
chunk turns out to need an INPUT_TYPES change, section-0 same-commit rules
apply and the plan must say so first. The bench items were conditional filler
and are now unreachable; that is fine.

**Ceiling to be honest about:** this can be built and unit-tested here, but its
real proof is a render. Renders HAVE RESUMED (2026-08-05), so the
`production-qualified` leg is runnable whenever a render window is free; until
it runs, claim only `code-complete + suite-green`.

### 2. THE NON-COMMERCIAL NOTICE REACHES NO HUMAN SURFACE (~30 min)

Fully scoped, ledger-clean, and the smallest real win on the board.
`nodes/OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:3590` stamps `meta["noncommercial_notice"]` (via
`_otr_provenance.noncommercial_notice`, `:124`) and logs it. **Nothing renders
it.** `nodes/otr_credits_roll.py:516` reads only `credits_source_line`.

Add a sibling printed-credits item beside that block -- `:516-518` is the exact
three-line shape to copy -- plus an integration test. The ledger field already
exists and already has an owner, so this adds a CONSUMER, not a field: no
ownership question to answer. Fires on Folger sources.

**Acceptance (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4):** `meta.noncommercial_notice` present -> ONE
rendered credits item; absent when empty, exact text, exactly ONCE. The
existing source item renders as `>> SOURCE: ...` (`otr_credits_roll.py:510-518`)
-- state the notice's literal prefix the same way, and the notice renders even
when a malformed legacy ledger lacks `credits_source_line`; ADJACENCY (source
line immediately followed by the notice, each its own `intercept` entry)
applies when both exist. No new wrapping helper: the existing intercept renderer already
measures and wraps every entry through `_wrap`
(`otr_credits_roll.py:1131-1135`). Test the ORDERED flow list (do not convert
`col3_flow` to a dict -- duplicate `"intercept"` keys collapse). Integration
fixture proves the Folger wording survives flow construction unchanged.
Legibility on canvas is eyeballed on the next permitted render, not claimed
from the test.

### 3. THE TEST-ORDERING POLLUTION (~30 min)

`tests/test_public_domain_sources.py` pollutes
`tests/test_public_domain_interpreter.py::test_empty_cast_is_rejected_and_retried_to_failure`.
Confirmed 2026-08-04: fails when the two run adjacently, passes **11/11** when
the interpreter file runs alone, invisible in full-suite order. Pre-existing --
already proven by stashing and reproducing at the prior commit.

Worth the half hour because it costs a real signal: any targeted run touching
those two files reports a red line that has to be re-diagnosed as benign every
time. **Build shape (r2 -- the r1 "cleanup fixture" idea was WRONG and is
withdrawn):** the mechanism is MODULE-IDENTITY breakage, not leaked state.
`test_module_import_is_lazy` (`tests/test_public_domain_sources.py:223-233`)
calls `importlib.reload(pd)` twice, which REPLACES the module's class objects,
while the interpreter test file imported exception classes at collection time
-- so `except OldClass` no longer matches instances raised by the reloaded
module. No cleanup fixture can restore class identity. Fix (r3-refined): run
the lazy-import assertion in a SUBPROCESS -- `sys.executable`, repo-root
`cwd`, `check=True`, fresh import with the read guard installed -- and pin
BOTH test-order permutations as regressions. The private-module-name
alternative is CUT: it risks exercising fallback import paths instead of the
production `nodes._otr_public_domain_sources` package identity.

### 4. THE SPOKEN-CITATION CODA STILL OWES ITS TESTABILITY (~2h, OPEN)

**The LEAK is closed and live-proven; the WORK below is not.** The old heading led with the closed half and a 2026-08-13 cleanup pass duly cut the whole section as done. Four coder items remain, and the two traps under them have each already cost real episodes.

The spoken-citation defect SHIPPED and is live-proven (`3943dd38`, `0957e169`,
`104c3f78`; receipt in `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` PBUG-20260805-04). Seven legs, six lanes,
zero leaked lines, and the corpus audit held at 69 findings across eight new
episodes. Licensed sources are now credit-only -- the announcer names neither the
licence nor the licensor, because Folger publishes the edition and Shakespeare
wrote the play.

What it still owes, all specified in `kibitz-runs/2026-08-05-item7-citation/r4/final.md`:

* **B4 -- extract the coda helper** so tests exercise the production reader.
  **TRAP:** do NOT extract `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:5463-5588` verbatim.
  `news_meta` is defined inside that range and read by the caller below it --
  extracting as written is a `NameError` on every episode. Both review lanes
  caught this independently. Keep `news_meta` in the caller.
* **B6 -- bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`** (`nodes/_otr_ledger.py:58`). The audit
  must REQUIRE `spoken_coda_source` on post-fix ledgers while tolerating its
  absence on the 1,587 legacy ones; without a version boundary a dropped receipt
  is indistinguishable from history. `LEGACY_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` in
  `scripts/audit_spoken_citations.py` is already written to expect the bump.
* **Writer-level routing tests** (depend on B4): both fidelity banks x
  {non-empty, empty} provenance, plus an owned/non-empty case with
  `_style_grammar_on == False`. Assert the coda is PRESENT, not merely that the
  URL is absent. Control is `media_archive`, NEVER `scifi_news` -- that lane
  dispatches to `scifi_news_circuit` and returns before this block.
* **Bug Bible coverage** -- mandatory per `CLAUDE.md`, not a judgment call. The
  rule to promote: **a fix applied to a function with no callers is not a fix.**
  The 2026-08-04 attempt at this same defect edited `spoken_coda_line()`, which
  had zero readers, and 30 episodes leaked after it "landed".

Also parked and owed a merge: another session's worktree
`.claude/worktrees/awesome-brahmagupta-a509b4` holds the uncommitted deletion of
the dead `news_coda_spoken_reduction` receipt chain and `finalize_news_coda_surface`
(no callers tree-wide, no producer for its two trigger flags). It stood down so it
would not collide with B4. Re-ground it against the new helper boundary, then merge.

### 5. 1,090 CAST ROWS CLAIM A NON-COMMERCIAL MODEL IS COMMERCIALLY CLEAN

`eng_indextts2.py:55` says `commercial_clean = False` (bilibili non-commercial);
all 40 bank rows say `true`; `cast_lock.py` trusts the bank row. The row flag is
the CLIP's licence and the engine flag is the MODEL's -- genuinely different
facts, both already in the right layers. **Stamp the JOIN. Do NOT edit the 40
bank rows** (`otr_dl_indextts2_refs.py:11-17` documents them as clip provenance;
the ingest mints three rows across three engines from one PD clip).

**Must heal ATOMICALLY or it creates the defect it fixes:** the stamp
(`cast_lock.py:742`), the `gated` counter (`:575/:614/:661/:670`) AND the three
report strings (`:578/:618/:673`) -- otherwise the report prints `clean=True`
beside a ledger saying `False`. Resolve ONE profile by `(role, engine)` --
role-scoped, never engine-name-scoped. **Enforcement stays OFF.**
Prospective-only for the 1,090 frozen ledgers.

### 6. A TERMINAL FREEZE GATE THAT HAS NEVER READ A POPULATED FIELD

`find_scene_coherence_issues` reads `lines[].scene_id`; the `scifi_news` lane
writes `beats[].scene_id`. 55 ledgers assert the check, 0 carry the field, 55
pass. Nothing in `nodes/` writes `lines[].scene_id` on ANY lane -- the check
never had a producer.

Join per line: `beat_id` -> beat -> `scene_id` -> declared scene. Add a **VACUITY
refusal** (an armed gate that examined zero linkages FAILS -- that is how this
survived 55 episodes). **Split request from verdict:** keep a
configuration-derived `scene_coherence_required` and write
`{required, checked, verdict, issues}` into `report.info` -- `run_gap_audit` is
READ-ONLY (`_otr_ledger_freeze.py:664-698`), so the gate must not mutate the
ledger; the phase wrappers already persist the report. Measure OFFLINE over the
published corpus first, then arm in ONE change -- no intermediate flag-off ship.
Replace the stale hard-coded bank list at `tests/test_scene_guard_v4.py:89-99`
with registry-derived coverage (it omits `scifi_news`, the one bank that enables
the flag).

**The vacuity class is now proven twice** -- this gate, and the freeze test at
`test_g9_sfw_ship_stop.py` that filtered on a retired code prefix (fixed
`4506b1ed`). Any NEW armed gate ships with a vacuity assertion.

### 7. CHARACTER GENDER IS ROLLED ON PROSE LANES -- Scrooge shipped female (spec REWRITE owed; r2 and r3 both returned NO)

Live 2026-08-05: `EBENEZER SCROOGE` = female, `JACOB MARLEY` = other,
`HENRY HARTWICK OGLETHORPE` = female. Meanwhile MACBETH, BANQUO, PROSPERO and
MIRANDA are all correct.

**The split IS the diagnosis, and it means the render code is not broken.**
Shakespeare ships 14 provenance sidecars carrying `characters` with genders; the
prose lane has ONE tracked sidecar and its `characters` key is `None`. The pin
chain already exists and is lane-neutral (`_otr_roster_gender.py`, 12.6 KB, on
disk). Shakespeare is right because the DATA is there. Prose is rolled because it
is not. **This is a vendor-time data gap with a working consumer** -- the exact
inverse of the Item 7 bug, where the value existed and nothing read it.

Spec: `docs/2026-08-05-character-gender-ladder-SPEC.md` (Fable, driver-grounded).
A four-tier TOTAL ladder -- roster -> pronouns in the source text ->
character-in-work web lookup -> name-frequency percentage -- stamping `gender`
(always populated, never `unknown`, because a voice must still be cast) plus
`gender_source` and a confidence. Operator rulings baked in: Shakespeare's KNOWN
rows are untouchable, the announcer stays randomly male/female by design, and the
invented lanes (`original`, `scifi_news`, `scifi_news_pro`, `media_archive`) keep
rolling -- their characters do not exist, so a name search there risks matching a
real person.

**Codex r2 verdict: NO. Eleven must-fixes, at `kibitz-runs/2026-08-05-gender-ladder/r2/codex.md`.**
The diagnosis survived; the mechanism did not. The three that matter:

1. **The web search would silently do nothing.** The spec passes a tools/plugins
   argument to `OpenRouterBackend.generate`, which swallows unknown kwargs through
   `**_ignored` -- no error, no search, a confident answer from a model that never
   looked. That is the same silent-no-op class as the defect above.
2. **"LLM extraction over the FULL unit text" cannot run.** `beckoning_fair_one.txt`
   is 143,176 bytes and 58 of 65 source files exceed 12,000 bytes, against a
   32,768 estimated-token per-call cap.
3. **Blanket surname aliases are identity-unsafe.** Two rows sharing a surname
   with the same gender currently produce a confident pin rather than an
   abstention.

**r3 RAN 2026-08-06 and it is STILL NO** -- Codex NO with 7 must-fixes, agy
yes-with-fixes with 9. That is three NOs across two rounds, and r3's findings invalidate
the CODING PLAN rather than its line numbers, so the standing re-ground rule applies:
**the next step is a SPEC REWRITE folding r2 + r3, then r3 again. Not r4.**

Both lanes independently found (a) a manifest sequencing deadlock -- the stamper is
specced to run per-unit inside the vendor fetch loop, but the manifest is written only
AFTER the loop, so it can never see the unit it was called for; and (b)
`RosterGenderVerdict` has no `gender_source` / `gender_confidence` fields, so the
ladder's whole output cannot be carried without changing every verdict-construction
path. Codex also confirmed the r2 finding that the OpenRouter backend still has no
web/plugin parameter, so the web-search tier would silently do nothing.

Judgment: `kibitz-runs/2026-08-06-2026-08-06-gender-ladder-r3/r3/judgment.md` (LOCAL
ONLY). **Trap: commit `496d9d57` inserted ~90 lines near the top of
`nodes/_otr_roster_gender.py`, so every cite into that file in the r3 review has
SHIFTED. Re-pin before acting.** The rewrite should also CONSUME the
`normalize_gender` boundary item 8 installed there rather than adding a second
normalization path.

**Found while grounding, and it reopens an operator ruling:** 32 of 85 Shakespeare
roster rows are `unknown` TODAY -- 38% of the lane assumed solved. Comedy of Errors
ships 7 characters, every one unknown. The narrower ruling that fits the evidence:
Shakespeare's KNOWN rows stay untouchable, but tiers 3-4 may fill only its
`unknown` rows. That fixes 32 rows without ever second-guessing a parsed
dramatis personae. **Operator decision, not a driver call.**

### Bench leftovers (relocated)

The old conditional bench block is gone (unreachable once item 1 grew, and two
of its three items already live in NEXT CODING QUEUE item 6). The remaining
one: **the three works that refuse to vendor** (`ghost_ship` gid 11045,
`purple_cloud` 11229, `beleaguered_city` 11521 --
`scripts/otr_vendor_public_domain_library.py:303/341/542` against the parser
at `:594-686`) **needs one Gutenberg fetch, so it is operator-opt-in only** --
not schedulable inside an offline sprint.

**Do NOT start the Shakespeare verbatim executor in this session.** It is a
multi-session structural change gated on the ownership table
(`docs/2026-08-03-fidelity-pass-ownership.md`) with four overwrite paths to close
first, and starting it half-way is worse than not starting it.

## HISTORICAL CODING BACKLOG -- subordinate to the current runway at the top

This 2026-08-04 inventory may still contain real work, but it is not the active
order. Re-ground any item against HEAD only after the current top runway reaches
it. The 2026-08-11 review routing at the top governs; no full arc is implied.

1. **Style/identity campaign, items 1-4 (one campaign, ~1 day).** Highest
   leverage: fixes the credits style line for all six banks uniformly.
   Re-verified: `run_story_brief_reflection` is `_otr_story_brief.py:446`;
   `_build_left` is `video_engine.py:1442`; the treatment line renders as
   padded `Style    :` at `video_engine.py:1762` (an earlier "no longer greps"
   note here was a driver grep miss, corrected by the r2 panel -- BOTH
   consumers are live and both move in the repoint). Sharper finding on
   item 4: `ending_template` is NOT "computed and never read" -- the catalog
   computes it (`_otr_style_catalog.py:906`) AND the composer reads it
   (`_otr_line_composer.py:809-810`); what is missing is the THREAD between
   them -- no call site passes it into a LineRequest. That is a DECISION GATE
   inside the campaign, not a confirmed build step: wire the thread or rip the
   dead ends, decided with the panel at build. Same for the ghost-name fork:
   **default = scrub briefs after cast lock** (conservative -- no unlocked name
   reaches the listener); the operator may overrule to propagate pitch names.
   `style_seed_env` confirmed validator-only (`capability_profiles.py:116`).
   Item 5 (the 120-key `meta` rip) stays a gated block of its own, NOT part of
   this campaign.
2. **The P0 repair rung tells the truth (2 items, ~0.5 day).**
   `repair_literal_source_metadata` (`_otr_scifi_source_repair.py`, called from
   `_otr_scifi_codex.py`): (a) emit a receipt per pruned span/evidence-row/fact
   -- silent pruning violates the plan's own Invariant 3; (b) give the repairer
   the `allowed_source_fields` allowlist or prune per row, so one bad rehome
   stops poisoning the whole artifact. Suite-provable with fixtures. The HTML
   block-join separator stays an OPERATOR decision (coordinate-system change)
   and is NOT part of this chunk.
3. **Script-parse repair: fix the SPEC, then code it (~0.5 day docs + panel,
   then 1-2 days code).** The claim that increments 1-5 are code-ready is
   STALE: `docs/2026-08-03-script-parse-repair-CODE-READY.md` itself says r3
   returned seven must-fixes that invalidate the call/trace design and
   everything after its STATUS block is a draft. The next chunk is the spec
   correction folding those seven in (a kibitz arc IS the vehicle); only then do
   increments 1-5 become codeable.
4. **Passage-lane craft scoring + the stichomythia floor (~1 day).**
   `_otr_passage_selector.py` has no scoring functions -- the Fable craft
   criteria (French-scene boundaries, entrance/exit starts, couplet ends,
   continuation-word penalties) are all unbuilt. Score, keep top-K, seeded hash
   within the class. Same chunk: the per-beat word floor excludes stichomythia,
   so a merge rule or floor exemption in `_otr_episode_budget`. Pure Python +
   tests. **Sequencing (r1): runs AFTER the ON DECK sprint lands and re-grounds
   against whatever item 1 changed** -- both touch the fidelity selection
   surfaces.
5. **Cast-list parser: the two weak plays (~0.5 day).** Midsummer 1/12 and
   Comedy of Errors 1/7 gendered -- mechanicals/servants in shapes
   `_otr_character_roster.py` does not read yet. Vendored texts are on disk;
   offline; suite-provable against the sidecars.
6. **Small-items batch (~0.5 day, ONE campaign over the batch, one commit each):**
   * `OTRImageGenDispatcher` (`otr_image_gen_dispatcher.py:1412`) has no
     `IS_CHANGED` while depending on external file existence -- confirmed by
     grep, none in the file. Decide the CONTRACT before coding (r2): either
     fingerprint EVERY actual external dependency or deliberately force
     re-runs for this side-effectful node -- a partial path fingerprint still
     serves stale results.
   * Rotated server logs have no retention policy.
   * The `provider_side` three-part-rule regression (picked AND forced
     `cloud_kling_avatar`).
   * The shared `row_is_active(...)` evaluator over captured state -- confirmed
     absent from the tree -- closing the four env-read sites named in OPEN BUGS.

## PARKED -- D2 (renders have resumed; run when a render window is free for fail-hunting soak legs)

Reset per AGENTS.md section 4, boot headless, run **320-word `public_domain` or
`shakespeare` still legs until one fails** (~1 in 6). Three legs on 08-04 all
published, which at that rate is a ~58% chance of zero -- neither confirmed nor
cleared.

**Either outcome is valid.** A publish is a clean leg; a **fail-closed with
complete evidence is the PROOF D1 WORKS** and is the outcome you want. When it
fails the server log names the branch itself -- arm, token, index, canonical
`prompt_hash`, repr-escaped excerpt -- plus a compact JSON `MISSING_TARGET`
record emitted BEFORE the raise (the canonical runner truncates the exception at
500 chars, `scripts/otr_api.py:749`). The log survives reboot;
`scripts/_otr_rotate_log.ps1` rotates instead of truncating. D3 then fixes THAT
branch at its root and `PROD_BUG_LOG.md` gets a mechanism, not a guess.

**Do NOT:** weaken the completion gate, revive the portrait-init fallback, or
rebuild the withdrawn "give the collapse guard a still owner" fix -- the 08-04
postmortem disproved that chain (70 whiffs and 69 cast-time deferrals across 11
passes that ALL published).

Record: `docs/2026-08-04-POSTMORTEM-still-unmaterialized-320w.md`,
`docs/2026-08-04-D1-SHIPPED-still-skip-evidence.md`.

## AFTER THIS SPRINT -- the standing block order

One coder window at a time; every chunk = focused tests + full suite + Bug Bible
+ commit AND push + `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.

```text
  -> WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract  (CODE-COMPLETE; blocked on ONE operator
                                         decision -- see OPEN BUGS)
  -> [r3+r4] Randomizer A
  -> [r3+r4] dynamic_story           (wiring only -- rev-5 DESIGN stays FINAL)
  -> re-observe the PARKED story bugs on the next real render legs;
     batch-triage whatever is left
  -> THEN, and only then, ROADMAP.md -- OFF THIS PLAN
       (its order after the SFX park: product expansion -> LEAN-MEAN ->
        RunPod -> release)
```

**LEAN-MEAN IS NOT IN THIS QUEUE and must not be re-added.** Operator direction
2026-07-29 moved FRONT and TAIL both to the Lean-mean campaign section of
`ROADMAP.md`, with their chunk chains, the W2 migration-first mandate, the
ENGINE_MATRIX W6 sub-step and the full `r2 -> r3 -> r4` pin carried over intact.
It runs after the randomizer and `dynamic_story` (the SFX step that used to sit
between them is PARKED). A window that wants to rip dead code is on the wrong
document.

**Block detail:**

1. **Randomizer Rolls Design A** -- `docs/2026-07-12-randomizer-rolls-r2-coding-plan.md`.
   NOT gated any more: extensibility landed and absorbed its `_otr_lane_specs`
   authority, so this shrinks to `_otr_bank_roll` + eligibility. Its r3 brief must
   carry two deltas -- the absorbed authority, and that the bank list is a LIVE
   registry read (`list_bank_ids()` can return a CLIENT bank; eligibility must
   treat one as an ordinary peer) rather than a six-row literal. 1-2 d + 1 GPU day.
2. **`dynamic_story` visual direction** -- rev-5 FINAL; roster-agnostic; re-derive
   IDs at build. After the randomizer. The "do not rerun the design panels" rule
   and the r3+r4 requirement are NOT in conflict: the rule protects the DESIGN,
   r3 asks whether that design still wires to the code that exists today, and the
   roster, the routing authority and the writer tail have all moved since rev-5.
   5-9 coder-days + 2-4 GPU days.
3. **SFX campaign -- SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06. It is not parked any more; it is
   being RIPPED.** The 2026-08-04 park (operator doubt + an 8-15 coder-day lift)
   became a deletion when the operator ruled *"I do really want to rip out SFX
   100%, that's my aim."* **The live work is section 0-TER of this document**;
   this entry survives only so a reader who remembers "parked" finds out here
   that it expired.
   Nothing spends against a REVIVAL, and now nothing preserves one either: the
   Timeline Cue Ledger and generated-SFX designs are slated for retirement with
   the code. What the rip does NOT touch is the b-roll role tombstones (they
   still fail loud on stale ledgers) or the `[ENV|SFX|MUSIC:]` text sanitizers
   (defence against a model hallucinating a tag, not an SFX feature).

Open judgment question (render-window, not a coder slot): the LOCAL mistral/gemma
writer matrix. The Sonnet arm of the creative-writer question is answered
(`docs/2026-07-17-model-bakeoff-scoreboard.md`); the local roster comparison
never ran.

### STANDING RE-GROUND GATE -- r3/r4 before ANY block above (operator 2026-07-24)

Every remaining block was planned against a tree that no longer exists. Since
those docs were written the LLM vetoes were ripped, THE LAW landed, six banks were
renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings were retired, the whole extensibility
build shipped, and the suite grew past 8,000. Line cites, seam names and file
inventories are the first things to rot, and every one of these blocks is a rip or
a rewire that acts on exactly those.

- **Default entry point is `r3` (wiring).** These plans already have an r1 and an
  r2 on record, so the cheap re-ground is wiring against CURRENT code, then `r4`.
- **Drop to `r2` when r3 finds the CODING PLAN wrong**, not just the line numbers.
  Stale cites are an r3 fix. A seam that no longer exists, an authority that moved,
  a precondition another build already satisfied or destroyed -- that invalidates
  the coding plan itself, and patching an r2 from inside an r3 produces a plan
  nobody reviewed.
- **If in doubt, start at r2.** A wasted r2 costs one panel round; executing a
  stale coding plan costs a day of rips against the wrong file list.
- **No block executes without an r4 convergence at current HEAD.** Record the run
  under `kibitz-runs/<date>-<block>-r<N>/` and cite it in the block entry.

## SCOPE FOR v2.0 (operator -- read before picking up fidelity work)

**Two banks, not three.** `shakespeare` is VERBATIM and gets the executor.
`public_domain` stays PROSE and is explicitly allowed to be FUZZY -- operator: "the
LLM's job to try to do book prose but not perfect", and "I'm fine if it can pick up
real dialogue great, if not that's OK". Best-effort, never verbatim, never gated.

**But fuzzy WORDING is not the same as melding two stories, and that distinction is
the actual requirement.** Operator: "public domain does need to be updated so it
doesn't try to meld two different radio drama things and tries to keep true to the
source." That names the delivered defect exactly -- an H.G. Wells chapter performed
as taking place in "Arkham, Massachusetts", Lovecraft's fictional town, with the
time machine shrunk to a pocket watch. Two authors fused into one episode. The
contract for this bank:

* FREE with the wording. Invent the speech; carry the source's own quoted lines
  where they exist (the Wells chapter has real ones -- "Story!" cried the Editor).
* NOT free with the WORLD. Its place, people, period and events are the source's.
  No relocating, no importing a second work's setting or characters, no genre
  transposition.

Two changes serve that, and neither is a gate:
1. **PROMPT-ONLY** -- the pack asks for the source's world and its own quoted
   speech, and forbids importing anything the source does not contain.
2. **Stop the content-blind rolls contaminating it.** A catalog sound world ("a
   fire in the grate, a mantel clock, a teacup") was imposed on Wells' Richmond
   parlour, and `arc_shape` stamped "heist" on a man demonstrating a time machine.
   Foreign frames arriving from a dice roll are melding by another route.

**`public_domain_plays` is DEFERRED TO v2.1**
(`docs/2026-08-03-public-domain-plays-PLAN.md`, research complete, nothing built).
That avoids a third bank row, which is never one line: it would force a pack
directory, a registered fetcher, an executable pipeline, family-policy coverage and
updates to exact-roster contract tests.

**Two hard operator rules that override the repo's written ethos here:**
* **The word count is a REQUEST, not a gate.** No refusals, no hard gates, no
  shunts. Shipped: `select_passage` returns its closest performable passage rather
  than raising (`a4bc7917`).
* **No "dread py assertion workflow killers."** A render must not die. The
  reconciliation: fail loud in AUTHORING-TIME TOOLS (the fetcher, manifest
  validation -- things a human runs and reads), but in the RENDER PATH degrade to
  the best available result and write an honest machine-readable receipt into the
  ledger saying what degraded and why. The ledger tells the truth; the episode
  still ships. No hazard / under-construction flags -- `runnable` was checked and is
  NOT one; all six real banks are runnable and its only job is making the
  "+ Add Your Own" signpost fail loud on selection.

**An extra LLM VERIFIER pass is sanctioned** ("is this accurate to the story, are
these characters really in the scene?") -- but as a RE-SELECT, never an abort: if it
rejects a window, take the next-best candidate, bounded, then ship the best one with
a receipt. **Deferred until specced (r1):** it currently has no stated input, output
or artifact position. If built, it reviews the FINAL accepted script, stays
advisory/non-terminal under THE LAW, and records evidence-backed findings; until
that spec exists, do not quietly add another model pass.

**Casting must be smart about voices and gender.** The dramatis personae section is
the ROSTER and its descriptions carry gender; it is parsed at VENDOR time into the
provenance sidecar so the render path never infers (`d8752d69`). A manifest-approved
roster also replaces the refuted "speaker appears twice" heading rule -- that rule
would have deleted BEATRICE's single speech from `much_ado__act3_scene1`, the scene
named for her, where that one speech IS the payoff.

**Still open on casting:**
* **Midsummer 1/12 and Comedy of Errors 1/7 gendered** -- mechanicals and servants
  in cast-list shapes not yet read, recorded `unknown` rather than guessed. Operator
  is open to a vendor-time LLM/web lookup as the final tier for stragglers, under
  its own `gender_source` so it stays auditable. (Corpus elsewhere: AYL 6/6, Lear
  9/9, R&J 3/3, Much Ado 4/4, Tempest 3/3, Twelfth Night 5/6, Macbeth 7/8.)
* **Voice-pool capacity may belong in window ELIGIBILITY, not just casting.** The
  Bark pool is 6 male / 4 female against a 6-character ceiling, and Macbeth 1.3
  needs five distinct voices.
* **Disguise ruling (settled):** ROSALIND-as-Ganymede and VIOLA-as-Cesario keep
  FEMALE voices -- the source prefix says who speaks and the irony depends on the
  audience hearing her; the announcer states the disguise from a manifest field.

**Visual style: randomized is fine** (operator). The earlier objection to
`archival_documentary` over a Folger comedy was about TRUTHFULNESS, not variety --
the credits claimed a story scaffold the episode did not have. With the words
genuinely the play's own and the strip naming the real source, a randomly drawn look
is artistic range. (`visual_style_policy` was RIPPED on 2026-08-04 accordingly.)

## THE PASSAGE LANE (operator ruling; built, with craft criteria still unbuilt)

> "For shakespeare I'm open to a version that is very strict and finds, based on
> word count and random choice, hones in on a specific part of a play to get real
> specific dialogue, no paraphrasing."

A play episode is a contiguous WINDOW of consecutive speeches, carried verbatim,
chosen to fit the word budget, the cast ceiling and the beat topology. Built as
`nodes/_otr_passage_selector.py` (`a82460ec`), 24 tests, proven on all 14 vendored
scenes: every selected line is verbatim from its source file.

**The number that governs everything:** a passage is performed against VOICED
BEATS, and beats step with the ACT TOPOLOGY, not the word count --
`voiced_beat_count()` in `_otr_episode_budget` is the one owner. 30-120 target words
buy THREE beats, 150-200 six, 300-1200 fourteen. At 120 words a passage is a
two-or-three speech fragment; at 300 it is an eleven-to-thirteen speech exchange.
**The fidelity floor should be 300, not the operator's initial 120** -- three beats
cannot hold a change of mind, and every manifest already recommends 300. A long
speech spans consecutive beats in the same voice (`ceil(words/80)`,
`BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX`); without that the lane silently loses Lear's love test,
Prospero's history and Juliet's balcony speeches.

**Craft criteria for selection, from the Fable review -- NOT yet implemented:** keep
windows inside one French scene (never cross an `[Enter ...]` that adds a speaker);
prefer starts on an entrance or a question, penalise openings on continuation words
(And/But/Nay/'Tis) and speeches under 4 words (Folger prints shared verse lines
separately, so those start mid-breath); prefer ends on an exit, a scene end or a
rhymed couplet, avoid ending on a question or a trailing dash. Score, keep the top
K, then apply the seeded hash within that class. Showcase example: Romeo and Juliet
2.2 lines 257-318, `[Enter Juliet above again.]` "Hist, Romeo, hist!" through
"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes... [He exits.]" -- 14 speeches, ~250 words, entrance
start, couplet-and-exit end, a complete arc that maps 1:1 onto the 14-beat topology.

**Prose is a different lane and the review was blunt about it.** Wells' chapter is
~70% narration; a characters-only performance discards the book's actual asset. The
faithful prose lane should be a NARRATOR/READER role speaking the author's own
sentences, abridged by CUTTING ONLY with every dropped span logged in provenance --
"abridged verbatim", which is also the period-correct radio form. Defer the
paraphrased variant until a dialogue-poor source genuinely needs it: as specced it is
indistinguishable to a listener from the existing original lane with borrowed names,
and it reopens the failure class just closed. If built, the announcer must say
"freely adapted from".

**Also flagged, unfixed:** the per-beat word FLOOR (20 at three acts) excludes
stichomythia -- "Nothing, my lord." / "Nothing?" / "Nothing." cannot be three beats --
so rapid exchanges need a merge rule or a floor exemption; `[aside]` and `[within]`
are machine-readable delivery hints worth carrying into per-beat metadata; and the
Wells manifest synopsis says the traveller "returns with a strange machine" when in
the real chapter he returns limping and the machine never appears.

## THE ADAPTATION DESIGN (hardened, NOT yet built)

Plan of record: `kibitz-runs/2026-08-03-adaptation-fidelity/r2/final.md`.

**The keystone correction: compile source speech, do not generate it.** A ledger row
that merely POINTS at a source segment proves structure, not meaning --
`PRODUCTION_SPRINT_LESSONS.md` lesson 11 documents that exact failure class.
Source-owned text must be materialized deterministically from an authenticated
segmented artifact and verified against it. "Summarize into X words" then means
SELECTING WHICH REAL SEGMENTS FIT THE BUDGET, not paraphrasing -- which also removes
the VRAM hazard, since no model sits in the source-speech path.

Settled by arithmetic: an episode cannot exceed **1,520 words** (19 voiced beats at
act_count 7, `BEAT_WORD_HARD_MAX` 80), so full-scene performance is impossible
without redesigning beat topology. Build target is the 300-word unit.

**NEXT, IN ORDER:**

1. **The segmented source artifact** (schema, spans, hashes,
   `body[start:end] == segment.text`, omission receipts) and the pass-to-field
   ownership table -- **nothing else codes until that table exists.**
2. **Cast from the selected cut.** Real scenes carry 3-12 speakers against a
   6-character ceiling (`_otr_casting.py` 1-6, `OutlineRequest` rejects >6), so which
   speakers appear must follow from the cut that fits the word budget. Coupled hard
   to the capacity guard: at act_count 1 there are exactly THREE voiced beats, so a
   4-person cast is a mathematically guaranteed `CastVoiceCoverageError` -- the
   failure that killed `scifi_news` in the six-bank run. `compute_episode_budget`
   must also receive the TRUE locked cast.
3. **Loosen the count-match invariant** (`OTR_LedgerScriptWriter.py:4061-4067` hard-
   raises on any locked != requested) and change the pack text that tells the model
   to drop figures.
4. **Extend `_otr_provenance.py`** -- do not add a second attribution owner -- and
   bind its output to the verified body hash.
5. **Schema migration** to retire `cast_hints`; still required by the validators and
   by `public_domain_manifest_schema.json`, so manifests and tests migrate in the
   same change. (`visual_style_policy`, the other half of this item, was ripped
   2026-08-04.)

**KNOWN AND NOT FIXED:** `canonicalize_shakespeare_text` truncates at 12,000 chars
and the interpreter sees only the first 5,000, so a 3,445-word scene reaches the
brief as ~880 words, silently. Belongs with the artifact work, where each beat is
fed its own segment rather than a blind prefix.

## STYLE / IDENTITY DECISION WORK (backlog; not the next coder window)

Grounded by the 2026-08-03 four-agent forensics; every line has a file:line in the
session traces.

1. **"Invent one and tag it"**: add a derived style/genre field to
   `run_story_brief_reflection` (`_otr_story_brief.py:446` -- proven content-loyal on
   both specimens), stamp beside `story_brief`, repoint the treatment `Style:` line
   (`video_engine.py:1762`) and the HUD (`video_engine.py:1336` -> `_build_left`
   `:1466`) at it. Highest-leverage item here: it fixes the credits line for all six
   banks uniformly.
2. **Rename `meta.style` -> `meta.story_scaffold`** (operator: too many metas; the
   field is neither scifi nor a description). Consumers move in ONE atomic change:
   writer stamps, credits `_story_style_receipt`, `visual_plan.style`,
   `video_engine.py:1336`, tests -- AND the ledger validators (r3):
   `_otr_ledger_consistency.py` pins the field in its matrix
   (`MatrixRow("style", ...)` at `:68`, `:177`) and `_otr_ledger_cleanup.py`
   reads it too; missing them fails ledger validation on the first episode.
3. **Ghost-name reconciliation fork**: pitch cast never reaches `lock_cast` (names
   are a pure pool draw; `source_character_names` deliberately None for invention
   lanes). Decide: scrub briefs after cast lock, or propagate pitch names. Evidence:
   Evelyn/Leonard as offscreen lore; Fogbound Rails bio still opens "Lizzie Gray".
4. **Dead fields found**: `ending_template` computed but zero LineRequest call sites
   pass it; `seed_policy.style_seed_env` validated but unconsumed; `dramatic_state`
   derived PRE-dialogue goes stale in the treatment.
5. **`meta` is a 120-key drawer** -- the cleanup the operator keeps asking for. Scope
   as its own rip with the ledger law (every field one owner).

## OPEN OPERATOR QUESTIONS (flagged, awaiting a ruling)

* A research_only source now WITHHOLDS the OBS copy instead of killing
  the finished render (chunk 0.5 behaviour change, live since 08-15).
  If the operator wants the old kill-the-render behaviour back, it is a
  one-line revert -- say so.

* **Does `media_archive` want the catalog premise at all**, or the same
  scaffold-off treatment as `original`? Found by the five-bank beat test: a
  `pirate_radio_resistance_drama` premise was drawn over a film-reel standoff
  seeded by a real Library of Congress item on 'Midnight' (1939) -- the operator
  caught it on screen. Second specimen of the content-blind-draw class. The
  scaffold-off rule so far was stated only for `original`.
* **Rename the un-namespaced `OTR_WAN_*` knobs?** `eng_wan_i2v`'s six frozen knobs
  are `OTR_WAN_STEPS` / `_CFG` / `_SHIFT` / `_SAMPLER` / `_SCHEDULER` / `_NEGATIVE`
  -- no `I2V` namespace, unlike every sibling. Default if unruled: leave them. The
  freeze already removed the power that made the missing namespace dangerous (they
  are consent-act-only now and cannot bind a production leg), and a rename would
  silently break operator muscle memory for a sweep.
* **`style_tail_policy`'s closed enum cannot express a SHIPPED path.**
  `VALID_STYLE_TAIL_POLICIES` has `full` and `minimal_clean`, but
  `build_radio_host_prompt`'s `ltx_radio_mouth` branch
  (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:394-401`) RETURNS EARLY with
  `"%s, warm dramatic lighting"`, skipping both `finish_visual_prompt(...,
  era_profile="still")` and the `image_grade_tail` append -- deliberately, per the
  2026-07-02 operator look direction. The `ltx_audio_in` bookend row nonetheless
  declares `style_tail_policy="full"`. Adding an enum token is an operator call:
  either add a third token for "canonical warm, no era tail, no grade tail", or
  ratify that the `ltx_radio_face` path is EXEMPT from the plan's style-tail
  authority. Default if unruled: the exemption, because it changes no behaviour.
* **After profile retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The full
  statement of this one is in the WAN 8-GB row under OPEN BUGS -- it is the single
  blocker on a code-complete block.
* **`check_compatibility`: ratify the inert constant, or schedule the rip?** See
  Open risks.

## OPEN BUGS / DEFECTS (live, not yet closed)

MECHANICAL defects survive story-engine churn; STORY-QUALITY judgments do not. That
split is why the two eyeball-era entries at the end are PARKED rather than live.

**EVERY LINE CITE IN THIS SECTION IS SUSPECT.** Each one checked during the
2026-07-27 triage had moved: `_is_cloud_video_engine` is `render_driver.py:1599` not
`1274-1295`; the "NO FALLBACK to text-only" refusal is `:2148` not `1801-1817`;
`_use_i2v` is `eng_ltx_video.py:583` not `559-572`. The defects are mostly still
real; their coordinates are not. **Re-pin a row's cite when you touch it.**
Path note (verified 2026-08-04): engine adapters live under
`nodes/_otr_video_engines/` (and `_otr_audio_engines/`, `_otr_image_engines/`)
-- bare `eng_*.py` cites in these rows are shorthand for those paths.

### The 2026-08-11 bank-sweep trio (LEMMY sprint, all three OPEN)

Found by a six-bank live render sweep, not by tests. Full detail lives in
`docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md` and `docs/2026-08-11-FINDING-lane-cast-contract-divergence.md`;
these rows exist so a window working THIS list actually sees them.

* **PBUG-20260811-03 -- `scifi_news` lost the LEMMY cameo it was built for.**
  ROOT CAUSE ESTABLISHED: `scifi_news` is a CONTENT-OWNED lane
  (`delivery_mode_for_meta(meta) == CONTENT_OWNED`, measured off the sweep's own
  ledger; `original` is `legacy`). Content-owned runners build their own cast and
  never run the writer's seeded picker, and `lock_cast()` is what applies the
  cameo -- so it cannot fire there. The empty `cast_contract` is the same
  deliberate decision: that block stamps `meta.episode_seed` and withholds
  `cast_seed`, because claiming one on a lane-owned cast detonated CastLock's
  replay before (`num_characters must be 1-6, got 0`).
  **THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE WRONG ONE** -- routing content-owned lanes back
  through `lock_cast()` is precisely what that comment warns against. The repair
  belongs in the lane runner. **Operator row 15.**
  *Worst of the three by exposure:* nothing fails and nothing logs, so every
  `scifi_news` episode since the redesign has shipped with no cast contract.
* **PBUG-20260811-01 -- forcing the cameo kills the `scifi_fable2` writer on
  `scifi_news_pro`.** `pass 'script' failed after 4 attempt(s): markup ladder
  exhausted; BAD_LINE`. Reproduced at 30 AND 90 target words, so NOT a word
  squeeze; with the cameo on its natural roll the writer passes cleanly. Root
  cause not established.
* **PBUG-20260811-02 -- `scifi_news_pro` dies at node 92 with no materialized
  still for beat `music_closing_001`** (`still-spine handoff missing materialized
  scene still ... engine still_flat`), on the same profile where five other banks
  produced one. Seen ONCE. Re-run before treating the cause as understood.

### The P0 / source-span cluster (2026-07-30)

- **`full_text` reaches the span coordinate system carrying HTML BLOCK JOINS WITH
  NO SEPARATOR, and on the live evidence this is the DOMINANT P0 failure cause.**
  Measured in the campaign logs: `'...Field of Martian PolygonsNASA/JPL-'`,
  `'...and the School ofEngine'`, `'...what you're doing.Let's s'`, `'...(AMR).The
  resea'`. The RSS adapter strips tags without inserting whitespace, so two elements
  fuse into one token. `_normalize_span_source_text` collapses whitespace RUNS but
  cannot insert a space that was never there, so the model quotes the sentences a
  reader sees and they are not byte-exact in the stored text -- exactly the
  "non-literal source span" rejection that killed 12 of the 15 P0 legs.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed by A-3:** inserting separators is a WIDER change to the
  coordinate system `source_digest` pins -- an operator decision, and it belongs in
  the source adapter rather than the codex normalizer. Owed: which adapter builds
  `full_text`, whether a separator can be inserted at admission without breaking any
  accepted ledger, and a fixture from these four strings.
- **The deterministic P0 rung PRUNES SILENTLY, which violates the plan's own
  Invariant 3.** `repair_literal_source_metadata` drops an unsupported span, then its
  evidence row, then the fact -- and emits no receipt. An accepted P0 index simply
  has fewer facts than the model wrote, and nothing says which were dropped or why.
  Under "fail loud, not fatal" the degrade is the right direction and the silence is
  not.
- **The deterministic P0 rung is ALL-OR-NOTHING across an artifact, and can poison
  its own good work.** It is handed `a0_payload` (all seven keys) while
  `_validate_fact_index` restricts spans to `allowed_source_fields` (the projection).
  A quote rehomed into a field the projection omitted makes `post_validator` reject
  the WHOLE repaired artifact -- "cites source field ... outside the supplied P0
  evidence" -- so one unlucky rehome discards every correct prune in the same pass.
  Either give the repairer the allowlist or prune per row.
- **Nothing measures whether a pruned P0 index is ACCEPTED** (recorded, no action
  owed yet). No live leg has ever run with the deterministic rung reachable (it became
  reachable at `47c554fa`, after the campaign stopped), and the rejection logs carry
  only a truncated `raw head` plus no source payload, so the question cannot be
  answered offline. A-1's instrumentation is what makes the next campaign able to
  answer it.
- **`scifi_news` P0 convergence defect** -- both 120w and 320w legs fail in P0 after
  two attempts on non-literal fact source spans; provider/model convergence, extends
  BUG-11.35. NOT a word/length gate. Blocks the last 120w receipt and the
  `scifi_news` live reverify (PBUGs 20260712-22/23/24/25, fixed in tree, reverify
  still owed).
- **`scifi_news_pro` provider capacity** -- `requested_output=2800` vs provider cap
  `512`; the whole-artifact retry contracts LANDED @ `314dd481` are the base; the
  residual fix is now unblocked. Related independent items: the P9 8K
  structured-capacity follow-up + the GGUF structured-enforcement NEWBUG. Do not
  raise the minimum word target as a capacity workaround.

### The 8 GB / profile cluster

- **WAN 8-GB low-VRAM launch contract -- CODE-COMPLETE and PROOF-INCOMPLETE. It is
  not a coding item; the one thing blocking it is an OPERATOR DECISION.**

  **Already BUILT and WIRED end to end** (verified hop by hop): `otr_8gb_wan.json`
  `video.max_render_frames=17` -> `capability_profiles` optional-key validator ->
  `_otr_workflow_apply.py:532` flatten -> `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_wan.json`
  node-87 widget slot 14 = 17 -> `otr_video_director.py:423` policy stamp ->
  `otr_shot_lock.py:1722` `ledger.video.max_render_frames` ->
  `render_driver.py:3328` per-adapter policy -> `motion_common.profile_max_render_frames()`
  -> `eng_wan_ti2v._floor_length` hard cap (`:730`) and `_planned_length` refusal
  (`:785`), with `render_driver.py:3845` refusing on drift. Landed `f914f0a4`, dead
  node-87 widget repaired `7f4644a1` + `8f41af27`, WAN deliberately excluded from
  `frame_contract.PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` by `b23fc035`, recipe frozen `71753cb4` /
  `8424f369`, whole-beat single-UNET-load `439ce8c7`. Regression net:
  `tests/test_remaining_video_contracts.py:16-194` (nine hop-by-hop tests) plus
  `tests/test_multiclip_effective_contract.py:216,234`.

  **THE ONE OPERATOR DECISION (the actual blocker).** The ceiling reaches a leg ONLY
  through a variant workflow or a hand-set widget: `otr_canonical.json` node 87 ships
  `max_render_frames=0`, so a plain canonical WAN run is UNPINNED and inherits
  `_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES = 177` -- exactly the 2026-07-23 failure shape. The obvious patch
  (pin 17 in the canonical) is WRONG: the canonical serves every tier, and 17 is the
  8-GB tier's number, so pinning it would cap LTX/HuMo 16-GB legs too. The channel
  that carries 17 today is `config/profiles/*.json`, which is on the RETIREMENT list
  -- so writing new behaviour onto it is forbidden. **Decision needed: after profile
  retirement, who owns a tier's native render ceiling?** The shape that fits the
  per-adapter-ownership doctrine is that `eng_wan_ti2v` DECLARES its own tier ceiling
  (a capability-row field), the widget becomes an operator OVERRIDE with 0 meaning
  "use the adapter's own contract", and the profile channel stops mattering. That is
  a real design change with a live-behaviour blast radius on any card with headroom
  (the VRAM predictor currently gets to ask for more than 17 and often can), so it is
  NOT being written on assumption. Ratify the shape first.

  **Also open, all PROOF obligations rather than build work:** the 18-engine GPU
  campaign is engine COVERAGE, not an 8-GB qualification; and a render on a PHYSICAL
  8 GB card is still owed -- the four-arm bench PREQUALIFIED on a 16 GB card told to
  reserve 8 GiB, which is not the same claim.

  **One untested edge, cheap to close whenever this reopens:** WAN is out of
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`, so a tier ceiling and a multi-clip plan CAN contradict by
  design, and `_planned_length` hard-refuses mid-episode when they do -- but no test
  asserts a 17-frame tier survives a multi-segment beat. `:216`/`:234` in
  `test_multiclip_effective_contract.py` pin the topology, not that outcome.

- **THE 8 GB PROFILE FAMILY CANNOT RUN ITS OWN WRITER** (found 2026-07-27;
  LIVE-REPRODUCED TWICE on two different banks, then confirmed by a two-strikes
  kibitz panel -- codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high and agy independently reached the same
  diagnosis). `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` pairs a 12B GGUF writer
  (`gemma-4-12b-it-Q4_K_M`, 6.63 GB of weights) with `llm.gguf_n_ctx: 2048` under a
  declared `vram_ceiling_gb: 6.8`. The pipeline's own smallest prompt needs **2064
  input tokens** and P0 reserves 2800 output (`_P0_BASE_OUTPUT_TOKENS`), so the leg
  dies in `OTR_LedgerScriptWriter` before any render. Live preflight, verbatim:
  `Needed=8.13 GB (weights=6.63, kv=1.40 @ n_ctx=2048)`. **ctx is the SYMPTOM; the
  writer MODEL is the cause** -- 4096 puts it near 9.4-9.5 GB, OOM on the very card
  the tier exists for. Every 2048-ctx profile (`otr_8gb_ltx`, `otr_8gb_wan`,
  `8gb_lite`, `cpu_floor`, `otr_amd8_rocm`, `otr_cloud_lanes`) is `status=draft` and
  every one pairs 2048 with the 12B; the only `status=shipping` profile is
  `16gb_full` (4096 + Mistral-Nemo). **NOT a one-line profile edit:** the GGUF
  registry ships exactly two rows (`unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF`,
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`); `google/gemma-2-2b-it` is in the TRANSFORMERS catalog, a
  different lane -- agy proposed it and was wrong, recorded so nobody re-derives it.
  **Largely mooted by profile retirement:** with no profile passed, the canonical
  JSON's own `gguf_n_ctx=4096` / Q8_0 binds and the leg runs. **Fix the profiles or
  finish retiring them; do not leave both.**

- **A2 -- HELD pending the profile retire-now vs retire-later scope. The profile's
  `llm` section silently overrides the canonical JSON, and the applied-overrides echo
  HIDES it.** Held because its entire subject is `apply_profile_to_workflow` and the
  printed echo -- a channel directed to be retired, so building on it now may be work
  on something scheduled for deletion. The fix SHAPE is correct and ready when the
  scope is settled. The profile's `llm.*` values win over the widgets the operator set
  in `otr_canonical.json` (which ships `creative`/`technical` = `google/gemma-4-12b-it`,
  `gguf_n_ctx=4096`, `gguf_quant=Q8_0`, `llm_vram_ceiling_gb=14.5`), while
  `scripts/otr_api.py:817` flattens only `role_overrides` / `slot_overrides` /
  `features` + two `seed_policy` keys for the printed summary -- so the run reports
  "16 overrides" while ALSO having replaced the entire LLM configuration. **Causal
  chain corrected** (triage 2026-07-27, codex; grounded): the override does NOT come
  from the validator's `OTR_ACTIVE_PROFILE` export -- it happens at submission,
  `scripts/otr_canonical_api_run.py:157` -> `apply_profile_to_workflow`; and the real
  applier (`nodes/_otr_workflow_apply.py:492-540`) ALREADY flattens `llm`; only the
  printed echo is stale. **Fix: generate the echo FROM the applier's flattened map.**
  Adding `llm` to the echo by hand leaves the next drift intact.

- **The `ltx_8gb` render-length ceiling has TWO owners that only agree by
  coincidence** (found 2026-07-27, B6 panel, two lenses independently). The coverage
  PLANNER reads `config/profiles/otr_8gb_ltx.json` `video.max_render_frames`, and
  `ltx_8gb` is the sole member of `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES`. The ADAPTER's own
  pre-render refusal reads `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES`. Today both land on 161 (profile
  unpinned, env unset), so nothing breaks. But `workflows/variants/otr_8gb_ltx.env.json`
  ships `OTR_LTX_8GB_MAX_FRAMES=97` and NOTHING currently reads that file. The day a
  launcher honours it without also pinning the profile, the planner emits a 98-161
  frame segment and the adapter refuses it MID-EPISODE -- after the stills are minted
  and, on a multi-segment beat, after the 6.34 GiB checkpoint is hoisted.
  **Deliberately NOT fixed in B6:** pinning the profile to 97 changes how a 237-frame
  beat partitions, which is a production planning decision, not a cleanup. The preset
  carries a `_ceiling_note` saying do not export it alone. Compare WAN, which B3
  wired correctly: `otr_8gb_wan.json` sets BOTH `launch.env.OTR_WAN_TI2V_MAX_FRAMES`
  and `video.max_render_frames`.

### Coverage, canvas and clip-contract

- **The route lock is ONE NODE TOO LATE for the image phase** (found 2026-07-25, node
  order confirmed against the canonical JSON: `87 VideoDirector -> 88 ImageDirector ->
  89 MetaBrief -> 90 ShotLock -> 91 ImageGenDispatcher -> 92 VideoRenderBatch`).
  `resolve_final_shot_engines` runs at node 92, but stills are minted at 91 and image
  PROMPTS at 89. The landed fix closed the spine-validation gap; the image phase still
  relies on its own MIRROR (`otr_meta_brief_image_prompt._effective_prompt_engine_for_role`,
  whose docstring says it "mirrors the image dispatcher's effective-engine seam").
  **Chunk 1 of the coverage block is the fix.** Note node 89 precedes node 90, so
  hoisting to ShotLock still does not put MetaBrief downstream of the authority --
  that needs a VideoDirector-time freeze and is NOT in scope. (This is also the
  "image-phase still ownership" item from the campaign queue.)
- **THREE silent coverage mechanisms exist, not one** (found 2026-07-25).
  Mechanism 1, the engine mirror/ping-pong (`wrapper_bridge.extend_frames_to_target`),
  is GONE from `eng_ltx_8gb` -- pinned behaviourally by a test that detonates the
  helper and renders successfully. It REMAINS in `eng_wan_ti2v`, deliberately and
  permanently: WAN renders a short native clip on purpose and fills the beat with it,
  which is the shipped 8GB tier contract `PBUG-20260723-02` protects. **Still open:**
  composite loop-fill (`otr_silent_composite._should_loop_fill`, which also SUPPRESSES
  its own underrun warning once it activates) and held-last-frame. For `ltx_8gb` the
  composite path is now de facto unreachable -- the adapter returns exactly the
  requested count or raises -- but not structurally impossible:
  `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` reports the size of the array it piped into ffmpeg
  rather than re-probing what ffmpeg wrote, so an encode-side drop could still
  under-report. PRE-EXISTING; close it when the assembly boundary is next opened.
- **`_should_loop_fill` names the permanent fix and it is now being built**
  (`otr_silent_composite.py:244-266`): *"The real fix is phrase-chunking (render the
  beat's correct duration so it never underruns) -- tracked as a follow-up."* The
  coverage block IS that follow-up.
- **THE 7d-PREFLIGHT THAT "PROVED THE GPU" RAN AT THE WRONG CANVAS** (found
  2026-07-27, B5 panel; verified -- and it corrects a claim this file once made).
  `render_single` and both HTTP entry points use the older ledger-free `build_request`,
  which never reaches the canvas seam and defaults to `OTR_VIDEO_RENDER_CANVAS`
  (832x480). So the "GPU IS PROVEN" leg (`ltx_8gb`, 25 frames, 3004 MB) exercised
  832x480, not the production canvas. `render_single` parity is explicitly deferred by
  the O1 judgment; what must NOT happen is another "proof" through that harness being
  read as a production proof. (The 512x288 canvas itself HAS since rendered live --
  bench arm D, three cells -- but through a DIRECT-NODE graph, which proves the canvas
  and the recipe, not the seam.)
- **The ShotLock WRITE-side canvas validation is still owed** (O1 judgment item 1).
  `otr_shot_lock.py` stamps `video.canonical_canvas` unvalidated from a possibly-empty
  policy. B5 made this non-load-bearing for the render (the engine declares its own
  canvas now), so it is no longer urgent -- the drift guard in
  `tests/test_ltx_8gb_canonical_canvas.py` covers the disagreement that matters. Close
  it when the general canvas resolver lands.
- **Odd-canvas evenness is validated at the ENCODER, not where the canvas is chosen.**
  The stride defect itself is closed (`b1f2ee86`): `ffmpeg_silent_mp4_cmd` declares the
  REAL width/height and `encode_frames_to_silent_mp4` REFUSES an odd canvas by name,
  because yuv420p subsamples chroma 2x2 and cannot represent an odd dimension. Still
  true and NOT fixed: neither `WanInitImageMixin._dims()` nor the `Canvas` schema
  validates evenness, so an odd canvas is caught late rather than at the choice. No
  live producer builds one today (832x480, 512x288, 1472x832 are all even).
- **`CanonicalClip.frame_count` -- "the integer timing authority" -- HALF CLOSED**
  (`58e288af` + `40780b82`, count closed @ `48e3c6fb` without paying a decode). Every
  module that writes a clip now ffprobes it, and a roster gate in
  `tests/test_terminal_frame.py` fails by name for any module that writes a clip
  without proving it. What this proves and what it does not: it proves the muxer wrote
  what it was piped, which is the right question for a clip written by ONE ffmpeg
  pass; it does NOT prove decodability, which is why `assemble_beat_segments` still
  decode-counts every ASSEMBLED beat and must keep doing so. **Re-verify before
  acting:** this row's "still self-declared elsewhere" pointers (the four `viz_*` and
  four `still_*` engines) were both closed afterwards, so the remaining open surface
  may be empty.
- **KNOWN LIMIT of the widened roster gate**, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a
  surprise: the codec flag is matched as a STRING CONSTANT, so a flag assembled at
  runtime (an f-string, `"-c:%s" % stream`) or the stream-index spelling `-c:0` is
  invisible to the sweep. Nothing in the tree does that today; an encoder that ever
  needs to must be pinned in `_ENTRY_POINT_PROOFS` by hand, which the inventory test
  makes a visible decision. Separately, ONE mutant survives the round by construction:
  deleting the self-proving membership assertion is catchable only by a meta-test of
  that assertion.
- **`ltx_av` underruns long beats** (found 2026-07-25, codex; confirmed). It caps at
  `_LTX_AV_MAX_FRAMES` (`eng_ltx_av.py:58`, default 497, env-overridable) and clamps
  at `:950-953`. It is NOT "renders to target natively" as three earlier docs claimed.
- **Ping-pong on a capped HuMo beat played lip sync BACKWARDS** -- FIXED in code @
  `a1d810f1`, but the finding is STATIC (no live artifact), so it is NOT a PBUG row. A
  capped-14B leg would reproduce it. Kept here so the live proof is not forgotten.
- **`docs/ENGINE_MATRIX.md` reports the DECLARED contract only** (found 2026-07-27).
  Correct today and consistent with its own stated design (every number read from the
  live registry). But the moment a profile pins an `ltx_8gb` ceiling, the matrix keeps
  printing `9-161 step 8` for a tier whose real window is narrower, and the `--check`
  drift gate cannot notice because it diffs the registry, which the effective contract
  never touches. Owed at the prequalification step, not before.

### Routing, env-capture and the credits card

- **`wants_talking_prompt()` escapes any routing freeze.** It calls
  `_recipe_config(self._recipe())` and `_recipe()` (`eng_ltx_av.py:402-432`) re-reads
  `OTR_LTX_AV_RECIPE` / `OTR_LTX_AV_SHARP` / the UNET name on EVERY call by documented
  design ("Read fresh every call"). So a `required="when_engine_talking"` row evaluated
  through the hook re-reads the environment after capture. S0b-core needs ONE shared
  `row_is_active(...)` evaluator over captured state, with the talking result inside
  `ltx_resolved`.
- **`provider_side` is a THREE-part rule, not an attribute.** `_is_cloud_video_engine`
  accepts a `cloud_` id prefix OR the attribute OR `node_key.startswith("cloud_")`.
  `cloud_kling_avatar` has no `provider_side` attribute and is caught by the id prefix
  alone, so an `engine_facts` builder using a bare `getattr` would classify it local
  and let the radio-host redirect send a cloud avatar to local LTX. Needs a regression
  on picked AND forced `cloud_kling_avatar`.
- **Four env-read sites missing from the S0b inventory:** `eng_ltx_video.py:541-564`
  (`OTR_ENABLE_LTX_I2V`), `render_driver.py:1176-1203` and
  `otr_meta_brief_image_prompt.py:297-300` (`OTR_ENABLE_HUMO_HOSTS`), and
  `eng_ltx_av.py:352-353,403-432` (recipe/UNET re-read outside `assert_usable`).
- **The credits card needs a SMALL-CANVAS VARIANT, and the ladder is not it.** At
  512x288 (the ltx_8gb tier) col1 is 65px past its footer even with every ledger row
  this policy may drop already dropped; at 640x360 it is 12px over. Both are drawn
  anyway (a terminal node never destroys a finished episode) and LOGGED at ERROR
  naming the canvas -- the old behaviour was drawn, clipped by PIL, silent. At 288
  lines the three-column console is already a polite fiction: col3's scrolling
  transcript is as unreadable as anything col1 clips. This is a DESIGN job -- a card
  laid out for a small canvas -- not more ladder heroics.

### Test-harness and tooling

- **The B7 forbidden sweep cannot see an UNTRACKED file, so a new test file passes the
  gate and fails one commit later.** `tests/test_b7_forbidden_sweep.py` builds its
  input from `git diff s29-clean-slate-gate -- *.py`, which covers tracked files only.
  A new test file added and gated in the same session is green; the moment it is
  committed it enters the diff, and a forbidden runtime identifier in it turns HEAD red
  with nothing else changed. Cost one red HEAD. **Not fixed, because the fix is a
  judgment call:** sweeping the working tree instead of the diff would widen the gate
  to every untouched file in the repo. Cheap mitigation until then -- re-run the full
  suite once after the FIRST commit of any new test file.
- **NOTED, not a defect: two `scripts/` bake-off runners now abort a whole sweep on a
  count mismatch.** `scripts/run_ltx_av_q_bakeoff.py:453` and
  `scripts/run_humo_bakeoff.py:660` call the encoder inside per-leg loops with no
  try/except and DISCARD its return value (both set `result["frame_count"]` from
  `int(frames.shape[0])` independently). A disagreement that was previously invisible
  there is now fatal to the run. That is the correct direction -- a lying count is not
  a leg worth finishing -- but a sweep operator should know it before an overnight run.
- **LATENT, not reachable today: the fewest-segments partitioner can accept a
  disproportionate trim on a WIDE discrete menu.** WIRE-W1 makes `partition_beat` take
  the lowest segment count that covers, including via a permitted tail trim. On a
  ladder that is always the right trade; on a DISCRETE menu whose largest entry dwarfs
  its smallest it need not be -- covering 1019 frames from a `(10, 999)` menu, two
  segments give `[999, 999]` and discard 979 frames where three give `[999, 10, 10]`
  exactly. **A bound was written, MEASURED and REVERTED, and the measurement is the
  point:** rejecting a trim of a whole smallest-clip turned `[12, 12]` into
  `[12, 4, 4]` on a `min=4 max=12 quantum=8` ladder -- a third render and a third model
  load to recover four frames -- across 4,885 cases in the sweep grid. The widest
  shipped menus are Veo's `(100, 150, 200)` and Pixverse's `(125, 200)`, whose worst
  real trim is 25 frames. Revisit only if an adapter declares a menu with an extreme
  ratio; the reasoning is recorded in `coverage_plan.partition_beat` so the next reader
  does not re-derive the bound and re-ship the regression.

### PARKED -- unverified at HEAD, re-observe on the next real render legs
(The 2026-07-24 "after SFX" checkpoint is VOID -- SFX is parked. The re-observe
now rides whatever real render legs come next, D2 included.)

Both were eyeball observations against a story engine that has since had its LLM
vetoes ripped, THE LAW imposed, six banks renamed onto new packs, word-fit ceilings
retired, the repair-first plan landed, and a ledger cleanup pass added. Neither has a
reproduction at current HEAD, and under the standing rule a finding with no
reproduction is not a row. **Do NOT schedule coder time against either.** They are
settled by the operator eyeballing a real render leg after SFX: still there -> re-admit
as a FRESH dated row with that leg as evidence; gone -> the LAW-era work already fixed
it, tombstone it.

- **Announcer framing defect** (`docs/2026-07-11-announcer-framing-defect.md`).
  Episodes START a story instead of admitting you into one; the announcer takes debate
  turns instead of framing. Operator eyeball 2026-07-11. If it survives re-observation
  the fix is still seam + score contract + fail-closed validator, never Python
  authorship.
- **Name-splice defect #2.** v4-campaign Phase 0 record in HANDOFF_LOG; its timebox
  predates THE LAW.

### Carried administrative rows

- **PBUG-20260710-07** -- root fix shipped; stays ROOT-OPEN in the log until ratified
  at the next operator fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f` is the retire candidate).
- **Phase-2 de-naming** (module filenames, `meta[]` ledger keys, wire-schema `.v4`
  literals) -- DEFERRED, operator-flagged, from the keep-6 rename.

## KNOWN OPEN -- do not rediscover these

* The VRAM admission guard covers coverage-executed beats only; the single-clip path
  returns via `render_shot()` first, and `ltx_audio_in` is not in
  `PLANNING_CAP_ENGINES` -- so the hottest-peaking engine is unguarded.
* `FRAME_COST_MODEL` is keyed by engine NAME while recipe/quant/LoRA/reserve are
  env-configurable; a measured row needs a calibration IDENTITY.
* Four adapters still cite missing receipts (`ltx_audio_in`, `mesh_stage`, `viz_green`,
  `viz_mxc_mandala`).
* The HuMo lip-sync onset fix is SPECIFIED but unbuilt, blocked on M1 classification
  (`BUG_BIBLE.yaml:2343`: audio leads the lips by 100-200 ms with the face static for
  the first 3-6 frames). Pre-roll + equal trim is algebraically a NO-OP if the lag is
  constant rather than onset-only, so the classification must come first: early-only ->
  pre-roll fix; constant -> advance the 25 Hz conditioning features; growing -> a
  rate/timestamp bug, not a pad. Run a matched no-LoRA control -- Kijai reports the
  lightx2v distill is not fully HuMo-compatible, so the defect may be ours.
* Cap authority is not yet collapsed to one (`video.max_render_frames` should be sole;
  env twins must be absent-or-equal).
* `otr_w45_campaign.py` runs SIX engines while claiming all local ones, and its
  acceptance would not reject a mirror. Fix before trusting a campaign result.
* The reuse detector cannot separate a deliberately quiet shot from a duplicated frame;
  it is ADVISORY in `otr_w45_campaign.py` until that is solved. The engine-layer and
  composite guards (`MirrorExtensionForbidden`, `ClipUnderrunsItsBeat`) are terminal
  and unaffected.
* `humo_1.7B` and `ltx_8gb` are marked CUDA-only with no fp8, no fp4 and no stated
  reason. Unexamined, not proven.

## MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET (operator, 2026-07-24 -- read this EVERY window)

Every window states, in its first reply, which rung of this ladder it is on and why.
Pick the cheapest tool that can win; escalate only when the cheaper rung cannot decide.
Both pools reset weekly -- front-load heavy coder windows and big Codex spends early in
the credit week; late-week, drop to the $0 rungs instead of grinding a paid pool dry.

| Rung | Model / tool | Cost | Use for | Never for |
|---:|---|---|---|---|

Production (in-pipeline, all $0/local, offline-first): writers = Mistral-Nemo (ctx cap
16384) + `gemma-4-12b` (saved runtime-qualified local default); stills/video-init =
`z_image_turbo` (the Qwen-Image ENGINE is removed -- keep Qwen3/Qwen2.5 LLM support and
Z-Image's `CLIPLoader(type="qwen_image")` encoder, unrelated). Cloud writers stay
opt-in bake-off arms, never the default.

Per-window mapping: RENDER windows = local production models + the Codex-app monitor,
Claude/Codex only to launch, judge and wrap. CODER windows use the cheapest competent
local triage first; Codex CLI is reserved for a genuine quandary/third swing and
Sonnet 5 performs post-code QA. **Review routing is the dated REVIEW ROUTING block at
the TOP of this file (2026-08-15), which RESTORED the panel and supersedes the
2026-08-11 suspension this paragraph used to cite.** Read it there, never from here.

## THE LAW (operator, 2026-07-22 -- supersedes anything that disagrees)

> **AN AUDIT MAY IMPROVE A STORY. IT MAY NEVER FAIL ONE FOR LENGTH, LANGUAGE, STYLE,
> VISUAL VOCABULARY, OR QUALITY.**

The sole terminal spoken-prose policy is the shared whole-word safety authority.
Structural JSON/schema/IDs/roster/source-proof/rights/graph/markup/nonempty/
provider-integrity failures remain fail-closed because they protect a usable ledger
rather than judge prose. Across all six banks, requested word length, actual word
count, drift, one-breath estimates, visual/world vocabulary, noun/POS heuristics,
casing/title/honorific style, craft, and quality are guidance or telemetry only -- they
may never reject, reroll, retire, replace, or block an episode. Same-story LLM cleanup
is allowed.

**SUPERSEDED IN PART (operator directive 2026-08-03, `CLAUDE.md`):** the
"whole-word safety authority" above is NO LONGER TERMINAL for episode content
-- no profanity or violence filtering on the generation path, and the source's
own language is carried as written on the adaptation lanes. The paragraph
above is kept as the 07-22 record; its STRUCTURAL half (schema / IDs / roster
/ source-proof / rights / graph / markup / nonempty / provider-integrity
fail-closed) still stands in full. The runtime filters that survived the 08-03
rip are inventoried and queued for removal as ON DECK item 5.

## Standing operator directives (hard)

* **The recipes are not on the table.** "We spent a lot of time perfecting the recipes
  to look good and we can't lose that." No VRAM, speed or cap finding justifies a recipe
  change; measurement runs the SHIPPED recipe unchanged. This specifically forbids
  reading "peak falls as frames rise" as a reason to raise the 97 trained-length cap,
  and makes the deferred no-LoRA HuMo control a recipe change rather than a control.
* **Per-segment rendering is BY DESIGN** -- "each audio clip takes its own journey, to
  keep VRAM low." Never classify an assembled beat as one render.
* **One coder window in the code at a time**, serialized through this file. Two windows
  editing the same file -- especially the workflow JSON -- is how it gets corrupted.
* The remaining hard rules (root-cause fixes, no content guardrails on generated
  episodes, no word-count chasing, the ledger-completeness rule for any ripped LLM
  pass, git policy) live in `CLAUDE.md` and are not duplicated here. Review routing is
  the dated REVIEW ROUTING block at the TOP of this file (2026-08-15), which restored
  the panel; the 2026-08-11 suspension named here previously is SUPERSEDED.

## Window packing (credit discipline -- one line starts any window)

Starting any window costs the same boot context, so BATCH chunks per window and never
open one for a single small item. Every window starts by pasting its one-line kickoff --
the `otr-handoff` skill reads this file + git and states the current step. No manual
context handoff, ever. The active coder keeps GO_FORWARD + HANDOFF_LOG current in
the same green push that closes a row.

| Window | Scope | Rung | Gate | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **STORY LAB (next)** | Resume external lab `7df7c80` with LF checkout; old `science_news` control versus current `scifi_news` challenger. OTR story code stays read-only until the lab hands back a converged transplant | local story models + Claude/Codex to code/judge; Sonnet 5 post-code QA | none -- operator opened it | evidence-driven |
| **OTR CODER** | After the lab converges, transplant its proven root fixes atomically into OTR; then Lemmy row 2; one green pushed chunk at a time | Claude/Codex codes and judges; Sonnet 5 post-code QA | Story Lab handoff | evidence-driven |
| RENDER | PARKED until rows 1-2 land. Then recreate the runner and execute the exact seven post-change proofs in current order. Reset per CLAUDE.md section 4 before every leg | local production + Codex-app monitor | bugs + Lemmy green | GPU days |
| PLANNER | Bug Bible operator fan-out + the `check_compatibility` fork; plan upkeep | rungs 2-4 | parallel with any coder window | docs |

**NEVER boot a window by letter.** Boot by the current runway at the top, always:

> resume the OTR Story Lab from `jbrick2070/ComfyUI-OTR-UpstreamStoryLab`
> current main `7df7c80` with LF checkout. Read OTR GO_FORWARD "STORY LAB
> RECOVERY BASE" and the top of HANDOFF_LOG. Use old `science_news` as the
> control and current `scifi_news` as the challenger; do not start blank or edit
> OTR story code concurrently. First make the typed ANNOUNCER opening introduce
> story/place/time plus the real-news premise, and make the typed ANNOUNCER ending
> summarize the source-backed news. Enforce opening music -> ANNOUNCER -> character
> drama/optional script-requested music -> ANNOUNCER -> closing music. State your MODEL & CREDIT BUDGET rung first,
> then the dated REVIEW ROUTING you actually read.

### If the window is a REMOTE / cloud Cowork session -- READ THIS FIRST

Learned the hard way 2026-07-26. A Cowork session running IN THE CLOUD is not the same
box as the repo, and two of CLAUDE.md's assumptions do not hold:

- **Read/Write/Edit hit the CONTAINER, not the Windows files.** In a remote window every
  read, edit and write goes through Desktop Commander against
  `C:\Users\jeffr\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-OldTimeRadio`, and so does git,
  the venv python and pytest. Everything else in CLAUDE.md holds.
- **There is a LAGGING Linux snapshot at `/mnt/user-data/uploads/`.** Never read the repo
  through it, and say so explicitly to every subagent -- a prior session's agents
  reported phantom corruption from that mount.
- **The bridge can drop mid-edit.** If the remote-device tools vanish, STOP -- do not
  retry in a loop and do not leave a half-applied edit. Report what is on disk,
  uncommitted, and wait. Nothing was lost when this happened because the last green chunk
  was already pushed, which is the actual argument for pushing every chunk.
- **The 60s MCP call ceiling.** The full suite takes minutes, so launch it detached
  writing to a `tmp/` log + a `.done` marker, then poll. PowerShell `*>` redirection
  writes UTF-16, so read results with `Select-String`.

## Parallel lane -- no coder slot required

- **Bug Bible operator fan-out** -- 9+ closed candidates + the duplicate-legacy_id
  cleanup waiting on one fan-out session.
- **Render-window fillers:** cpu-tier smoke (needs the google image lane or stills) +
  nv50 re-soak -- the two open portability remainders; release QA validation time, not
  coding.
- **SFX: RETIRED and RIPPED (operator ruling 2026-08-06, "rip out SFX 100%";
  executed `9eb6ede1` per `docs/2026-08-06-BUILD-SPEC-rip-sfx.md`).** The five
  bed engines are deregistered and barred via `RETIRED_ENGINE_IDS`, the bed
  compiler and mux mix branch are deleted, and
  `tests/test_rip_sfx_bed_guard.py` trips on any surface creeping back.
  Reviving SFX is a NEW design against the post-rip tree; the old design docs
  in `ROADMAP.md` are the historical record only.

## Bug Bible promotion field -- pending actions only

| Record | Pending action |
|---|---|
| `PBUG-20260712-22/23/24/25` | Live reverify -- blocked by the `scifi_news` P0 convergence defect, then fan-out |
| `PBUG-20260712-18/19/26` + `PBUG-20260713-15..18` + `-20` | Awaiting the next operator Bible fan-out (overlap check + approval) |
| `PBUG-20260713-19` | Live requalification pending (promoted BUG-05.11) |
| duplicate-id cleanup | Same fan-out: BUG-11.54 legacy_id -> `PBUG-20260713-21`; verify the acronym-union rule's legacy_id (both Bible rows cite `-10`; see the log's renumber note) |
| historical `PBUG-20260711-18` | Keep as a standing context/cap engineering risk; never eligible from static evidence |
| `PBUG-20260710-07` | Ratify retirement at the next fan-out (green codex leg `c1f3891f`) |

The active production-fix owner updates `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`; the approval queue is
`docs/BUG_BIBLE_PROMOTION_QUEUE.md`; no plan review or invented fixture creates a row.

## Validation and handoff law

- **Current whole-tree receipt (2026-08-07 @ `2fc81f72`):** full Windows suite
  **9081 passed / 111 skipped / 1 xfailed** (~4:19); Bug Bible **17 passed**. Prior
  receipts live in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` -- this file keeps only the current one.
- **Standing acceptance receipt:**
  `python scripts/audit_voice_gender_consistency.py --root "C:\Users\jeffr\Documents\ComfyUI\output\otr"`
  -- expect exit 0 over 1,595 ledgers. Exit 2 means the scan did not FINISH and its
  verdict is not a pass.
- Every code chunk: focused tests, full Windows suite, Bug Bible, AST/JSON/BOM/zero-byte
  checks, commit, push, verify `HEAD == origin/v2.0-alpha`.
- Every node/widget/link/schema change edits `workflows/otr_canonical.json` in the same
  commit and runs `OTR_WorkflowValidator`, JSON round-trip, strict link/input, live
  widget-vector, and generated-variant audits.
- Reset selectively before every headless run; never blanket-kill Python. Every run loads
  the canonical workflow and writes directly to canonical episode/OBS paths. Asset
  existence, not resident VRAM, proves completion.
- One coder edits code or `workflows/otr_canonical.json` at a time; read-only audits and
  documentation may run in parallel. HANDOFF_LOG + this file are the only tracking
  surfaces.
- **Count the suite on a clean tree:** `build_variants.py --all` also emits variants for
  any UNTRACKED profile on disk, and some profile checks are parametrized over the
  variants present, so another window's scratch profiles can inflate the number by a
  dozen tests that would not reproduce on a fresh clone.

## Open risks

- **NO CLIENT BANK HAS EVER RUN LIVE.** Every extensibility wave is proven by the suite
  and by contract tests, and the first real client bundle is still an unproven path end
  to end (fetch -> interpret -> writer -> cleanup -> tail -> publish). Treat the first
  live client-bank leg as a qualification, not a formality. Deferred power-user tiers
  (client own-runner + staging, dependency manifest, standalone story_rules) are
  explicitly OUT of v1 and are a NEW block if the operator ever wants them.
- **CLIENT-AUTHORED PYTHON executes in-process** (wave 3). The posture that must hold in
  every future change: `--activate` is the consent act; the seam fails LOUD
  (`UserBankExecutionError`) and never substitutes; client code never touches the
  canonical ledger; owner IDENTITY is verified so a bank can only run its OWN bundle; the
  shipped fetcher/interpreter registries are never widened to admit a client id. Do not
  relax any of these for convenience.
- **The client-facing surface is LIVE TEXT, not just docs:** the `custom_source_bank`
  row's `guide_ref` is raised to the operator by `require_runnable_bank`, and the
  `source_bank` tooltip repeats it. Any future change to the activation path (folder
  name, CLI verb, restart behaviour) must update `nodes/story_packs/banks.json`, that
  tooltip and `docs/EXTENDING_OTR.md` together, or the product will confidently instruct
  clients to do the wrong thing.
- **`check_compatibility` is RESERVED, not wired** -- operator/planner decision flagged,
  with a 2-of-2 recommendation to RIP (codex and Fable independently, Claude grounded
  both). The argument that decided it: the "it reserves the name" benefit is FALSE --
  `BUNDLE_ENTRY_ATTRS` constrains what OTR-side code may request from
  `bundle_entry_point()`, it reserves nothing against clients, and activation provably
  ignores whatever a client puts under that name (`tests/test_otr_check_cli.py:335`
  asserts a bundle whose `check_compatibility` is a plain integer activates). The only
  artifact that reserves the name is the `EXTENDING_OTR.md` paragraph, which exists
  either way. Case AGAINST: churn on landed green code for zero behaviour change, and the
  plan of record already names the future consumer (randomizer eligibility). Blast radius
  if ripped: ~5 code sites, 2 test files, 3 docs; no workflow JSON, no routing, no
  source-payload consumer. **Not a coder chunk** -- either ratify the inert constant or
  schedule the rip as a planner chunk. Proposed doctrine line: a name published to
  clients before its consumer exists lives in the client-facing DOC as "reserved, no
  contract, ignored if defined" and nowhere in executable code, because code that names
  an interface is read as enforcing it.
- **The ledger-cleanup pass runs on EVERY bank, not just client banks** (`3d97a130`). It
  is a no-op on a complete ledger and costs no LLM call there, but two shipped-lane
  behaviours did change and are worth watching on the next live legs: (a) unsafe spoken
  language on a `content_owned_readonly` bank is now REPAIRED at the writer tail instead
  of reaching G9 untouched, so a leg that used to die at freeze may now ship a sanitized
  line; (b) a blank `meta.episode_title` is now filled at the tail instead of exploding
  later in `otr_credits_roll`. Both are the intended direction under THE LAW; neither has
  a live receipt yet.
- No code lands mid-sweep of an active qualification campaign (the 420-rung
  uniform-code-confound lesson).
- `dynamic_story` touches the writer, the visual-style authority and the canonical
  workflow; it re-derives the live JSON at build. It is the only claimant on those
  surfaces.
- Generated-SFX R4 stays local/ignored evidence of a RETIRED campaign (the
  2026-08-06 rip, `9eb6ede1`); no R4.1 refit exists to run, and reviving SFX
  is a new design against the post-rip tree.
- Lean-mean front/tail drift: the constraint holds wherever it runs -- the tail's SW-1
  re-survey is mandatory against the then-current writer, and the two campaigns never
  share a window.

## Tombstones -- the only three a window might wrongly revive

Full list in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` + `docs/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`. These three are
here because each has been re-proposed at least once:

* **The 20 fabricated-fixture `public_domain` episodes and the fixture itself** --
  operator ruling 2026-08-04: dropped and deleted, **never raise again**.
* **v4 improvement campaign banks #2-#5** -- PARKED, superseded by the keep-6
  rename + THE LAW. Revive only by operator decision
  (`docs/2026-07-17-v4-campaign/final.md`).
* **LEAN-MEAN** -- lives in `ROADMAP.md`, not this file. A window that wants to
  rip dead code is on the wrong document.

## PARKED (operator ruling 2026-08-12): wire character casting to the VOICE REFERENCE BANK

**Status: PARKED, not rejected.** Operator: *"park it on go forward."* Raised
after the operator observed we should have far more voices than the writer is
being offered. He was right, by a wide margin.

### The finding, measured live

| pool | count | what it serves |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Bark `VOICE_PROFILES` (`config/cast_pools.py`) | **10** (6M/4F) | what the writer's casting menu offers |
| Kokoro presets on disk | 4 | ANNOUNCER only, a separate namespace |
| **Voice reference bank** (`config/voice_reference_bank.json`) | **204 declared, 153 resolvable on disk** (97M/106F/1N) | IndexTTS2 / Dia / Chatterbox cloning |

`_otr_voice_bank.default_char_engine()` returns **`indextts2`**, promoted to the
shipped character-voice default on 2026-06-04. It is a zero-shot CLONING engine:
`requires_voice_ref = True`, `voice_ref_kind = "wav_path"`. Every reference clip
is a distinct voice.

So the writer casts from **10 Bark presets** while the engine that actually
speaks the characters draws from a **153-voice reference bank**.
`_otr_casting.py` states it outright -- *"Open-character voices are always drawn
from the Bark pool (VOICE_PROFILES in config/cast_pools.py), so the tts_model is
Bark by construction"* -- and `_assert_unique_bark_voices` enforces uniqueness
across those 10.

### Why this is parked rather than done

`MAX_SPEAKING_CAST = 10` was set from the Bark pool and is therefore a Bark
artifact, not a real ceiling. But raising the constant alone achieves NOTHING:
`_deal_voice_menu` builds the menu from `VOICE_PROFILES` and refuses with
*"voice stock capacity 10 < cast size N"*. The actual work is pointing the
casting menu at the reference bank when the character engine is a cloning
engine.

**That is why it is parked and not done unilaterally.** It changes what
`voice_preset` and `tts_model` MEAN on every cast row, and cast rows are ledger
JOIN KEYS -- `cast[].name` / `char_id` / `voice_preset` / `voice_ref_id` /
`voice_engine`, joined from `lines[].speaker` and `beats[].char_id`. Under the
operator's hard rule (*the writer must OBEY the ledger for downstream content; a
hole in the ledger is a broken render*), a change of that shape needs every
field's owner enumerated BEFORE the call is moved, not after.

### What the work is, when it is taken up

1. Enumerate every consumer of a cast row's voice fields -- casting, TTS
   dispatch, per-beat audio slicing, credits, portraits, captions, `obs_publish`
   -- and name the new owner of each field. Exactly one owner each.
2. Make the casting menu engine-aware: Bark presets when the character engine is
   Bark, reference-bank entries when it is a cloning engine. Gender and
   `commercial_clean` already exist on bank rows.
3. Replace `_assert_unique_bark_voices` with an engine-agnostic
   one-voice-per-character invariant. The rule itself is right and must survive:
   two characters sharing a voice is a correctness defect.
4. Derive `MAX_SPEAKING_CAST` from the ACTIVE engine's pool instead of a
   constant. `tests/test_cast_size_is_a_request.py` already asserts the constant
   matches the live stock, so it will report the drift rather than hide it.
5. Prove on `scifi_news_pro` (the only bank on the fable2 writer) with a cast
   larger than 10 and complete speaker-to-`char_id` equality in the ledger.

Related and already shipped: `num_characters` is now a REQUEST rather than a cap
(operator directive, all banks) -- see `tests/test_cast_size_is_a_request.py`.

## LEMMY RUNS BEFORE THE SEVEN RENDER PROOFS (operator ruling 2026-08-13)

This supersedes the 2026-08-12 "all sweeps first" gate. The operator wants the
proven story/source-bank bugs fixed first, then Lemmy given a full fighting
chance, then the seven remaining render legs run as post-change acceptance.

The one-coder-window law still serializes every code edit. Lemmy is runway row 2,
not a parallel window. Re-ground Phases 2-4 and PBUG-20260811-01/-02/-03 against
the then-current tree, preserve the qualification-receipt contract, wire any new
authority into `workflows/otr_canonical.json` atomically, and document each green
chunk in `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` while removing it from this forward plan.

The render runner must be recreated only after Lemmy is green. Its seven legs
prove the code that will ship; no stale pre-Lemmy runner or prompt is admissible.
