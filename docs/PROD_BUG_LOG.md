# Production Bug Log (staging pre-Bible)

**Contract (operator, 2026-07-10):** Claude appends entries here AUTONOMOUSLY, but
ONLY for bugs that actually failed in a live/prod run (live render, headless lane,
soak, published episode). Dev/audit/review catches get fixed, never logged. NO entry
here touches the Bug Bible directly -- at ship time the operator triggers a BUG
FAN-OUT over this log, which promotes approved entries into the survival-guide
Bible in bulk under the Three-File Contract (YAML + README count + regression
test, one commit). Promoted entries get marked `PROMOTED <bible-id>`; rejected
ones get marked `REJECTED` and stay for the record. Append-only, newest last.
Running tests/bug_bible_regression.py after every code change stays automatic
and is unrelated to this log.

Entry format:

```
## PBUG-YYYYMMDD-NN -- short title
- surfaced: <which live run: smoke/soak/episode + date>
- symptom: <one line, what the operator/log saw>
- root cause: <one line>
- fix: <commit sha + one line>
- verify idea: <candidate machine check for the future bible test>
- bible-worthy: <yes/no guess + why -- operator decides at fan-out>
- status: OPEN | PROMOTED <id> | REJECTED

Backfill note: entries PBUG-20260612-01 .. PBUG-20260711-02 were mined 2026-07-10/11
by a two-agent backsweep (git history + handoff/smoke docs), prod-only bar applied,
cross-checked against BUG_BIBLE.yaml (BUG-11.26 family, 12.47, 07.16 excluded as
already promoted). Confidence tags preserved from the sweep.

## PBUG-20260612-01 -- headless boot dies on cp1252 emoji print
- surfaced: detached headless soak/API boot, 2026-06-12
- symptom: boot dies ~13s, exit 1, "SERVER DID NOT COME UP"
- root cause: detached cmd inherits cp1252; prestartup_script.py printed U+2705/U+2713 -> UnicodeEncodeError
- fix: scripts/_otr_soak_server_launch.cmd sets PYTHONUTF8=1 + PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8; rule codified in CLAUDE.md section 5
- verify idea: launcher-path boot succeeds; any new boot path asserts UTF-8 env
- bible-worthy: yes -- Windows console-codec boot killer, hits any custom node that prints unicode at import
- confidence: MED (sourced from operating-rules doc, no dated incident log)
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260616-01 -- LTX-AV soak VRAM peak 15.8GB over the 14.5GB cap
- surfaced: LTX full-episode soak, 2026-06-16 (976ab329)
- symptom: soak measured 15.8GB peak on a 14.5GB gate, both device modes
- root cause: Gemma text encoder stayed GPU-resident through the LTX pass
- fix: b0925c37 moved encoder to cpu; 1e5d66f4 REVERTED it after soak re-measure proved the offload ineffective -- record documents a fix attempt that live evidence disproved
- verify idea: full-episode soak VRAM peak check; assert S9 offload state matches the reverted decision
- bible-worthy: yes -- "the obvious offload fix measurably did nothing" is worth pinning so it isn't retried blind
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260618-01 -- remote creative slot crashed episode with KeyError
- surfaced: live run with creative_model='openrouter:slot-a', 2026-06-18
- symptom: episode aborted at line-compose with KeyError
- root cause: resolve_creative_system_prompt did rows[repo_id] against a CURATED_LLM_MODELS-only dict; remote handles aren't in it
- fix: 1f196ac3 -- rows.get(repo_id) with MODERN-prompt default
- verify idea: full episode with a remote slot handle completes, modern prompt used
- bible-worthy: yes -- exact-match lookup vs non-curated id, recurring trap
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260618-02 -- visualizer soak found 4-bug integration cluster
- surfaced: Task 2 visualizer soak, 2026-06-18 (4a92ed66, 21 clips)
- symptom: crashes/misbehavior on 0-frame beats, silent beats, missing master-audio slice, over-gated audio_ref
- root cause: four missing guards -- no 0-frame floor, no idle-scope handling, audio_ref wrongly gated in assert_usable, b000 master slice never fed
- fix: afab1a3 + c5c14c90 + d4607974 + bad1bba3
- verify idea: visualizer soak forcing silent/0-frame beats, status=success
- bible-worthy: yes -- soak-found cluster, four distinct root causes
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260620-01 -- published episode bars overlay read the silent source
- surfaced: obs-final render pipeline, 2026-06-20 (8d7e6604 verification)
- symptom: bottom bars overlay baked flat/green instead of audio-reactive in a PUBLISHED episode
- root cause: bars overlay read the silent blend source instead of the master WAV
- fix: f6788882 -- bars read the master WAV
- verify idea: obs final render, assert bars track master audio amplitude
- bible-worthy: yes -- defect shipped to a published artifact
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260622-01 -- UnboundLocalError crashed every episode at flag-stamp
- surfaced: night-soak window, 2026-06-22 (096ef64e)
- symptom: every episode crashed with UnboundLocalError at execution
- root cause: local `import os` inside run() made os function-local; the L2/L7 meta-stamp referenced os.environ before the local import line executed
- fix: 096ef64e -- local import at the stamp site; suite never exercised the heavy node so it slipped through
- verify idea: end-to-end test exercising the L2/L7 stamp; lint for mid-function shadowed imports
- bible-worthy: yes -- Python scoping trap invisible to unit tests
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260622-02 -- announcer coerced to character role, voice engine crash
- surfaced: live-smoke, 2026-06-22 (ffe23245, "(live-smoke)" tag)
- symptom: pre-freeze sweep re-roled the announcer intro to character -> bark engine -> EngineUnusable
- root cause: cast_ids_from_ledger didn't exempt a cast row NAMED ANNOUNCER from role coercion
- fix: ffe23245 -- exclude ANNOUNCER-named rows from coercion
- verify idea: episode with announcer keyed as ordinary cast id renders clean
- bible-worthy: yes -- naming-convention trap in role coercion
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260622-03 -- stage-direction-only character line crashed voice render
- surfaced: live-smoked fix set, 2026-06-22 (f8a8645e)
- symptom: a line with zero spoken content reached the voice engine and crashed the render
- root cause: no handling for a dialogue row that was pure stage direction
- fix: e62081f9 recompose to real dialogue (root); 9a4f0a71 silence backstop (NOTE: backstop is a fail-soft -- flag against current no-fallback law at fan-out)
- verify idea: force a stage-direction-only line through; assert recompose path, no crash
- bible-worthy: yes -- degenerate-content class
- confidence: MED
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260623-01 -- refine-loop save failures racing the freeze cascade
- surfaced: live-smoke, 2026-06-23 (9f29f644)
- symptom: intermittent save failures during the refine loop
- root cause: loser-directory cleanup raced the freeze cascade
- fix: 9f29f644 -- ship the LAST revision, drop the racing cleanup
- verify idea: repeated refine-loop runs, zero save failures, freeze lands
- bible-worthy: yes -- race class, easy to reintroduce with future cleanup code
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260702-01 -- night-queue proof9c: VRAM ceiling breach, zero clips
- surfaced: overnight night-queue run, 2026-07-02 (4dd79dbe verdict)
- symptom: leg produced zero clips; VRAM ceiling ops breach mid-run
- root cause: never fully isolated; retried at 832x448 per the verdict
- fix: none identified (diagnostic verdict only)
- verify idea: n/a until root-caused
- bible-worthy: no -- unresolved diagnostic, keep for the record
- confidence: LOW
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260703-01 -- overnight soak died: Ollama daemon down
- surfaced: overnight model-matrix soak, 2026-07-03 (c36dfe3e)
- symptom: soak died mid-run, local-LLM legs had nothing to call
- root cause: daemon down; no preflight health check in the soak launcher
- fix: c36dfe3e -- daemon started, soak relaunched (env fix, not code)
- verify idea: soak launcher preflights daemon health before queuing legs
- bible-worthy: maybe -- precondition-check class, though root cause was environmental
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260704-01 -- Sonilo cloud music rejected 422 provider_rejected
- surfaced: live cloud-audio proving run, 2026-07-04 (8f146394 "FIXED+PROVEN live")
- symptom: music calls rejected HTTP 422
- root cause: requested duration under provider minimum, no floor applied
- fix: 8f146394 -- min-duration floor + trim
- verify idea: short-duration Sonilo request completes
- bible-worthy: yes -- cloud-API contract violation class
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260704-02 -- nano_banana_2 TypeError: string indices must be integers
- surfaced: live cloud-image coverage sweep, 2026-07-04 (606dc7f1)
- symptom: cloud_nano_banana_2 requests crashed with TypeError
- root cause: GeminiNanoBanana2V2 expects model as DYNAMICCOMBO_V3 dict; node sent a bare slug string (seedream's different node takes the bare string -- contract varies per node)
- fix: 606dc7f1 -- send the dict shape
- verify idea: live nano_banana_2 render completes
- bible-worthy: yes -- dict-vs-string contract mismatch across V3 cloud nodes
- confidence: MED
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260709-01 -- distinct Chatterbox voice ids shared one WAV
- surfaced: all-Chatterbox 30w OBS live smoke, 2026-07-09
- symptom: two logically distinct voice ids resolved to the same underlying WAV
- root cause: no same-asset/provider collision check when allow_voice_reuse=False
- fix: same-day fix blocks asset/provider collisions under no-reuse (see GO_FORWARD 2026-07-09)
- verify idea: resolve N ids under allow_voice_reuse=False, assert distinct WAV hashes
- bible-worthy: yes -- no-reuse-gate class for any engine with shared assets
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-01 -- gemma-4 Q8 silent n_ctx downgrade truncated concept JSON
- surfaced: original_radio live 30w smoke, 2026-07-10
- symptom: creative-slot output truncated -> schema failures downstream
- root cause: gemma-4 Q8 can't hold n_ctx 4096 on 16GB; silent 2048 downgrade
- fix: d526c8b7 creative slot -> Mistral-Nemo in canonical; portability S1 later made ALL silent n_ctx downgrades raise
- verify idea: request n_ctx over capacity, assert raise not downgrade (S1 test should already pin)
- bible-worthy: yes -- silent-downgrade class, though S1 now kills it globally
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-02 -- epilogue_missing false-positive killed a roll with outro present
- surfaced: original_radio live smoke hardening, 2026-07-10
- symptom: roll killed for "epilogue_missing" while the outro row existed
- root cause: detection check + slot pins mistargeted
- fix: 1c735c2d -- deterministic refutation when the outro row exists, pins retargeted
- verify idea: fixture with outro row at retargeted slot, assert no false kill
- bible-worthy: check overlap with BUG-11.26 family at fan-out (this commit was NOT in the four folded into 11.26)
- confidence: MED
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-03 -- QA judge "proved" a violation by quoting clean text
- surfaced: original_radio 420w night batch Roll A, 2026-07-10
- symptom: confirm judge killed a roll for news_source_framing citing the CLEAN intro verbatim
- root cause: judge kill lacked lexicon-only corroboration for closed-vocabulary classes
- fix: 3d32b265 -- news_source_framing + machine_attribution became lexicon-only kill classes
- status: PROMOTED (folded into Bible BUG-11.26 follow-on law c, survival-guide commit 2833863)

## PBUG-20260710-04 -- fable2 P3 reroll: jinja TemplateError on consecutive user messages
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 2, 2026-07-10
- symptom: TemplateError mid-render on the P3 reroll path
- root cause: reroll emitted two consecutive user-role messages; chat template requires alternation
- fix: fold reroll into ONE user message (docs/2026-07-10-fable2-s1b-smoke-hardening.md)
- verify idea: construct a P3 reroll, assert strict role alternation
- bible-worthy: yes -- chat-template alternation, easy to reintroduce in any lane
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-05 -- fable2 casting JSON truncated at 1000-token budget
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 18, 2026-07-10
- symptom: casting JSON truncated at ceiling; salvage pulled a partial object that failed schema
- root cause: 1000-token budget too small for the structured payload
- fix: budget 1400 + wrapper-tolerant before-validator (same doc)
- verify idea: near-ceiling casting payload completes without the salvage path firing
- bible-worthy: yes -- token-ceiling truncation-then-salvage class, already recurred cross-lane
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-06 -- fable2 word-band exhaustion: proportional band too narrow at small targets
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 17, 2026-07-10
- symptom: roll died on WORD_BUDGET exhaustion (54 words vs 24-36 band)
- root cause: +/-20% proportional band is only 12 words wide at target=30
- fix: absolute slack floor +/-25 words; proportional governs >=125w (same doc)
- verify idea: unit test _word_band at target=30, absolute floor governs
- bible-worthy: yes -- same defect class flagged UNFIXED in original_radio P1-1; not yet generalized
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-07 -- fable2 announcer row silently mutated to character+skip, reason null
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 22, 2026-07-10
- symptom: postamble row arrived speaker_role=character, skip=True, tts_skip_reason=null after a green 8-pass spine -- no compose-flag breadcrumb
- root cause: UNKNOWN -- an unsanctioned cast-keyed mutator downstream; ROOT MUTATOR STILL UNIDENTIFIED
- fix: partial -- announcer sentinel char_id exempts rows from cast-keyed paths; mutator not found
- verify idea: trace/assert every cast-keyed mutation path; no path may flip announcer without stamping a reason
- bible-worthy: yes, HIGH PRIORITY -- silent data corruption with unresolved root cause
- confidence: MED
- status: OPEN (ROOT CAUSE OPEN)

## PBUG-20260710-08 -- fable2 injected fictional character into the real-news read
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 9, 2026-07-10
- symptom: model placed its fictional heroine ("Lia") in the read-only real-news pass
- root cause: no gate against invented cast names leaking into the source-read pass
- fix: cast-name-in-read gate with teaching error (same doc)
- verify idea: fixture with fictional name in read output, assert gate rejects with repair prompt
- bible-worthy: yes -- fiction/fact bleed class, distinct from verbatim grounding
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-09 -- fable2 CODA terminal punctuation killed a clean draft
- surfaced: scifi_fable2 30w live smoke roll 15, 2026-07-10
- symptom: otherwise-passing draft killed solely for CODA ending '.' instead of ':'
- root cause: colon is structurally load-bearing to a parser; treated as stylistic by the model, no normalization before the check
- fix: pivot colon normalized in shared pre-lex (flagged); inner sentence break remains the true defect (same doc)
- verify idea: CODA ending '.' normalizes before parse, no false kill
- bible-worthy: yes -- structural-punctuation-as-parser-key class; original_radio P2-2 flags same risk
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260710-10 -- scifi bake-off canonical smoke halted at Codex P0: source-span mismatch
- surfaced: first scifi_codex canonical 30w live smoke (roll 2a), 2026-07-10
- symptom: technical model returned a fact whose source_spans quote != the payload slice; validator correctly halted before any dialogue/media spend
- root cause: repair prompt not explicit about field/start:end slice contract; typed repair reproduced the mismatch
- fix: hardened originating-slot repair prompt showing required payload[field][start:end] identity + slice-mismatch diagnostics, applied to ALL THREE lanes (cross-lane audit found the same contract shape in Gemini/Sonnet P0)
- verify idea: offset-span fixture converges within the repair ladder budget
- bible-worthy: yes -- evidence-span contract class, cross-lane by construction
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN

## PBUG-20260711-01 -- scifi bake-off Codex P0: evidence-ID shape F0/F1 vs required F01/F02
- surfaced: scifi bake-off canonical 30w smoke roll 2b, 2026-07-10/11
- symptom: local model returned evidence IDs F0/F1/F2 where the v4 contract requires zero-padded F01/F02/F03; P0 validator halted the run
- root cause: typed-repair contract didn't give the model explicit lexical ID mappings; ID-shape expectation implicit
- fix: repair contract tightened at the shared lane boundary across Codex/Gemini/Sonnet -- explicit lexical ID mappings + recompute-quotes-from-payload-slice instruction (dialogue untouched, metadata repair deterministic); roll 3 rerun pending
- verify idea: fixture returning unpadded IDs, assert repair converges to padded shape within budget; pin pad width in schema tests
- bible-worthy: yes -- ID-shape contract drift, second member of the P0-contract class with PBUG-20260710-10
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN (roll 3 exposed the NEXT defect rather than hiding it -- see PBUG-20260711-02)

## PBUG-20260711-02 -- scifi bake-off Codex P0: correct ID, wrong quote offsets (span-integrity)
- surfaced: scifi bake-off canonical 30w smoke roll 3, 2026-07-11
- symptom: after the ID repair converged (F0 -> F01 correct), the model repeated a quote with WRONG offsets -- a separate P0 span-integrity failure; validator halted honestly
- root cause: repair contract fixed ID shape but did not force offsets to be recomputed against the payload slice
- fix: fail-closed METADATA-ONLY repair module (nodes/_otr_scifi_source_repair.py + test): may reindex an EXACT quote already present in the source and normalize IDs; may NOT invent or rewrite dialogue. Dialogue rewrites remain the province of a later context-aware structured creative pass (premise + beats + cast lock + audit feedback in hand) -- operator ruling: never a blind Python hack or context-free LLM retry that breaks the story arc
- verify idea: offset-shifted exact-quote fixture reindexes deterministically; ID normalizer pins F0 -> F01 (NOT F00 -- an actual test defect caught during this fix); dialogue field asserted byte-identical through repair
- bible-worthy: yes -- completes the P0 evidence-contract trilogy (span fidelity / ID shape / offset integrity); strong class entry at fan-out
- confidence: HIGH
- status: OPEN
