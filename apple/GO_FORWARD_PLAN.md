# OTR Go-Forward Plan

**ONLY UNFINISHED WORK BELONGS HERE.** When work finishes, its receipt moves to
[HANDOFF_LOG](HANDOFF_LOG.md) or its own evidence folder and the row leaves this
page. A finished prerequisite earns **one clause inside the row that still needs
it** -- never a receipt, never a struck-through or "SHIPPED" row. The test is one
question: *does a row still in this file stop making sense without that
sentence?* No -> cut it.

Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and [standing rulings](OTR_STANDING_RULINGS.md) first;
this file does not restate them, and does not restate the review or push rules.
**For what already happened -- commits, measurements, receipts -- read
[HANDOFF_LOG](HANDOFF_LOG.md), newest entry first.**

## Live box -- 5080, do not reset (2026-09-25)

ComfyUI is on port 8000. A 1-act chain
(`C:\Users\jeffr\Documents\ComfyUI\output\otr\yt_chain.ps1`) runs until
08:00 local on 2026-09-25 or the first failure. At handoff the mime leg
(prompt `ea876b5c`) was still rendering; AnimateDiff is next. Do not kill
python, do not interrupt the queue, and do not reboot the server. Receipts
are the 2026-09-25 RENDER entry in the handoff log; the morning review is
Part A of [TEST_WAVE](TEST_WAVE.md). The red-test patch that sat uncommitted
in this tree landed as `004d07ac` (07:52); the tree was clean after it, and the
operator's rule from that morning is that it stays clean: no unpushed patches.
With it, `test_g4_admission_honesty` is green; `test_g2_canvas_truth` is the
one inherited red left for Part A.

## Operating order (hard)

1. **SCOPE AND DECIDE** -- more than one defensible answer? It lives here, and
   no code is written on it.
2. **CODE** -- one verifiable answer? Build it. An open fork elsewhere does not
   freeze a decided row.
3. **TEST** -- only when 1 and 2 are both empty.

A row that can only be settled by a live leg is not a row: settle it without the
leg, or cut it with the reason written in. Testing never settles a decide or a
code row (operator 2026-09-12 / 2026-09-17).

**Operator 2026-09-25: "the only thing is to regress test."** The regression
wave is open and is [TEST_WAVE](TEST_WAVE.md). The section 1 forks are his words
and do not hold it; the section 2 rows land on their own and each wave receipt
records the HEAD it ran.

## 0. The bar

> **"As long as it doesn't crash when it's not supposed to."** -- operator,
> 2026-09-11. *"I'm not expecting anything exact."*

Crash-class and durability-class defects are the work: an uncaught exception, a
live asset written where a sweeper can delete it, an identity that resolves
outside its episode, a machine that silently renders a configuration already
proven wrong. Aesthetic drift is closed.

## 1. SCOPE AND DECIDE

Open forks. One word from him closes a row into section 2, or cuts it.

* **Pre-push hook.** `build_variants --check` plus the sibling matrix checks
  from `.githooks/pre-push`. Changes how both boxes push.

* **Google BYO lane: stills-only by his ruling (67332dc5).** Veo on his paid
  Tier 1 project allows 2 requests a minute and 10 a day per model, and an
  episode makes 16 Veo calls, so no Veo shape fits. The stills shape (Gemini
  image, `still_flat`, Google TTS, Lyria, Flash / Flash-Lite writers) published
  English Hamlet 1.1 in 218 s on 2026-09-19 with no 429s. Veo override:
  `OTR_GOOGLE_VEO_MODEL_ID`. **The fork:** does a Google profile ship as a
  variant (a `SHIPPING_SET` recipe, a matrix row, the README block -- all
  generated) or stay a lane preset applied by hand? If Veo ever returns: 8-second
  clips (one call per beat) or a disclosed opt-in model rotation. One word from
  him.

* **Non-English episodes admit only Kokoro, so Shakespeare-in-translation
  cannot run on the Google lane until he says which languages Google TTS
  may voice.** Measured 2026-09-19: French Hamlet on `google_veo_low_1act`
  stopped in 29 s at `cast_lock.py:70` -- "engine 'google_tts' is not
  admitted on a French episode (row engines: ['kokoro']). Kokoro is the
  dance leader day 1." That is his 2026-09-12 ruling working as written
  (`config/episode_languages.json` rows list the admitted engines; English
  admits everything). Gemini TTS speaks every language the switch carries,
  so admitting it is one list entry per row -- but a voice on a language is
  an ear decision, not a config edit (see the French `ff_siwis` day). The
  English Hamlet leg proves the lane on Shakespeare content meanwhile. One
  word per language, or "all", and the rows get it.

* **`google_tts` refuses a cast row with no gender; `my_story` leaves an
  unstated gender empty by design.** Measured 2026-09-19 on the second live
  leg of `google_veo_low_1act`: the canonical's bank is `roll`, the roll
  landed on `my_story`, two of three characters (Stomp, Whiskers) carried
  `gender: None` because the operator's story never states one -- and
  `_otr_my_story.py:26` says so on purpose ("a gender they did not state is
  never guessed from a name"). `cast_lock.py:1303` (citation fixed
  2026-09-24; was `:1282`) then raises `VoiceCastingError ... NO FALLBACK`
  for `google_tts`, where the Kokoro
  path takes the gender-agnostic draw and ships. Two rules that are each
  right collide only on this lane. The fork: (a) let `google_tts` take the
  same seeded gender-agnostic draw Kokoro takes when the SOURCE deliberately
  left gender empty (provider voices are gendered, so the pick is a coin
  the seed flips -- deterministic, disclosed in the report line); or (b)
  keep the refusal and have `my_story` say up front that a Google-voiced
  run needs every character's gender stated in the story. (a) ships more
  episodes; (b) never puts a voice on a character the author left open.
  The lane test moved on with `--source-bank original` (LLM-owned cast, the
  40/40/20 draw always sets a gender). One word from him picks it.

* **The Comfy key rides a V1 hidden input, and ComfyUI copies V1 inputs into
  error history.** Since the 2026-09-19 credential rip, nine nodes (writer,
  ShotLock, meta-brief prompt, stills, video, music, both voice nodes, the
  validator) declare `"hidden": {"api_key_comfy_org": "API_KEY_COMFY_ORG"}`.
  That is the V1 channel: `execution.py:230` puts the key into
  `input_data_all`, and when a node RAISES, `execution.py:630-653` serializes
  every input -- hidden included -- into `execution_error.current_inputs`,
  which lands in `/history`. Before the rip only the writer had this
  exposure; now every credit-spending host does. ComfyUI's own partner nodes
  avoid it by being V3 `io.ComfyNode` classes: the same credential arrives
  through `v3_data` (`execution.py:196-209`), which the error path never
  serializes. **Codex r2 named this as the pack-side mitigation and it is
  real.** The fork: convert the nine hosts to V3 (schema order must match the
  saved widget order byte-for-byte across 63 graphs, and the writer alone is
  ~3,500 lines), OR add one small V3 credential node that stashes the key per
  prompt and is wired into every host's `gate_in` (a canonical-graph change
  plus all variants, and it must return NaN from IS_CHANGED or a cache hit
  serves a stale key). Both are arc-sized. Interim risk, stated exactly: the
  reader needs `/history` on the server, and only a queue that both carries
  a key and raises exposes it. On the desktop boxes the server binds
  127.0.0.1, so that reader is already on the machine. **On the pod it is
  not:** [RUNPOD_INSTALL](RUNPOD_INSTALL.md) launches on `0.0.0.0` for the
  RunPod proxy, so on a pod a key-bearing queue that raises exposes the key
  to anyone the proxy admits (codex r3). Until the V3 shape
  lands, a pod run that spends Comfy credits should be treated as sharing
  its key with the proxy's audience. One word from him picks the shape.

### The registry push -- one batch, at the bottom, by ruling (operator 2026-09-19)

These ride the same publish and are deliberately last. The floor is
moving -- graphs are still being regenerated -- and a publish is the one action
here that reaches strangers and cannot be taken back.

* **Gallery -- built 2026-09-25, rides 2.3.4.** Comfy's scanner globs
  `*/workflows/*.json` one level deep, so the 24 variants in
  `workflows/variants/` shipped but never listed. Operator: "we can't store the
  variants in a subfolder" -- they now sit beside the canonical and the gallery
  lists all 25. The old worry here was wrong: the 2026-09-01 silent 404 came
  from a SECOND template-named folder, never from how many graphs one folder
  holds; `tests/test_workflow_templates_single_folder.py` still keeps it to one
  folder and now pins the listed set to the canonical plus the shipping rows.
* **Delete `v2.0-alpha`.** Unblocked: 2.1.1 is Active and the registry icon
  points at `/main/`. One click, his.
* **Flagged registry versions.** 2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 are Flagged;
  2.3.2 and 2.3.3 are Active (read 2026-09-25). The API gives no reason --
  there is no `status_reason`, no scan result and no queue position on any
  endpoint. His Discord, not a code change.
* **2.3.4 carries `asset_cleanup`** (built `3e01b1c6`, 2026-09-25): a new
  trailing writer widget the saved graphs need, so the Active 2.3.3 cannot run
  what `main` ships. Bump when he says; `pyproject.toml` is untouched until then.

## 2. CODE -- decided, in order

### 0. Remaining voice-route deletion (hardened 2026-09-24)

The unused `nodes/_otr_voice_route.py` module and the policy / portable-bank
fields that only compile if it exists. Spec:
[ROUTE_DELETION_PLAN](ROUTE_DELETION_PLAN.md) (re-grounded 2026-09-25).
Do not start from the 51b6c146 draft. Do not re-rip `91ad5961`.

### 0a. Windows HF_HOME -- always pin a short root (decided 2026-09-23)

When the models-adjacent pin cannot fit MAX_PATH, do not decline.
Choose a short root (registry if it fits, then models-adjacent if it
fits, then `C:\ComfyUI-Models\huggingface` if that tree exists, else
the huggingface_hub-shaped user cache). Spec:
[HF_HOME_WINDOWS_PIN](HF_HOME_WINDOWS_PIN.md) (re-grounded 2026-09-25).
`47703d7a`'s error-message half stays; its decline-to-pin does not.

## 3. TEST

Open by his word (2026-09-25). The wave -- the 5080 overnight review, the 4060
regression on the 8 GB rows, the suite and the Bug Bible -- is
[TEST_WAVE](TEST_WAVE.md). Do not freeze a head for it: each receipt records
the HEAD it ran.

## Already scoped -- do not build

8 GB ship set (its physical wave is [TEST_WAVE](TEST_WAVE.md) Part B) · `scene_coherence_check`
stays inert · no IP-Adapter on AnimateDiff · do not ping the Radeon tester ·
`stable_audio_3` listing `cpu` (re-read the published `--cpu` leg log before
editing the capability test) · **native-language science feeds for SciFi News
Pro -- OUT OF SCOPE (operator 2026-09-19: "forget it, delete, out of scope").
The lane reads the English feed and authors natively, and that is the shipped
behaviour. Do not reopen it as a feed-selection question.**

## Constraints specific to this plan

- Full listener source, no RSS. Cast count is flexible and records requested vs
  actual; the house announcer is excluded from the dramatic cast.
- **We do not chase act count** (operator 2026-09-11), the same rule as word
  count: the value is a request and a run delivers the closest performable
  episode.
- Model checking and a fixed attempt budget only -- no separate chunker, no
  recursive loop.
- An exhausted optional correction still yields a usable ledger; no predictive
  word or duration gate.
- Byline and attribution rules differ for My Story, Original and the adaptation
  banks.
- No replay, migration or re-render project: a saved input means fresh
  generation.

## Parked

**Vendored Shakespeare translations -- PARKED 2026-09-19 (operator: "cut our
losses so we can ship").** 43 scenes ship (it 13, fr 12, es 6, zh 5, pt 5,
ja 2). The full reopen record -- the scanned-lane speaker-emission gap, the
per-cell holds, the markup lessons and the open cell list -- is in git at
`d167f0ab:apple/GO_FORWARD_PLAN.md` (section 1 and section 2 row 1). Rights
are not a gate (standing rulings).

Not tracked further here: unqualified installed-family combinations, H3
policy receipts, cfg promotion
comparisons, the AMD scoped pod and platform acceptance, cloud billing opt-in
routing, operator-parked casting/adaptation ideas, OTR-Lite after v2, the release
runway, the missing `device_options` test module, regenerating
`apple/MODEL_ASSET_INDEX.md`, and writer widget-label cosmetics.
